CHAPTER I. I GO TO STYLES

The intense interest aroused in the public by what was known at the
time as ‚ÄúThe Styles Case‚Äù has now somewhat subsided. Nevertheless, in
[7m--More--(0%)[27mview of the world-wide notoriety which attended it, I have been asked,
both by my friend Poirot and the family themselves, to write an account
of the whole story. This, we trust, will effectually silence the
sensational rumours which still persist.

I will therefore briefly set down the circumstances which led to my
being connected with the affair.

I had been invalided home from the Front; and, after spending some
months in a rather depressing Convalescent Home, was given a month‚Äôs
sick leave. Having no near relations or friends, I was trying to make
up my mind what to do, when I ran across John Cavendish. I had seen
very little of him for some years. Indeed, I had never known him
particularly well. He was a good fifteen years my senior, for one
thing, though he hardly looked his forty-five years. As a boy, though,
I had often stayed at Styles, his mother‚Äôs place in Essex.

We had a good yarn about old times, and it ended in his inviting me
down to Styles to spend my leave there.

‚ÄúThe mater will be delighted to see you again‚Äîafter all those years,‚Äù
he added.

‚ÄúYour mother keeps well?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúOh, yes. I suppose you know that she has married again?‚Äù

I am afraid I showed my surprise rather plainly. Mrs. Cavendish, who
had married John‚Äôs father when he was a widower with two sons, had been
a handsome woman of middle-age as I remembered her. She certainly could
not be a day less than seventy now. I recalled her as an energetic,
autocratic personality, somewhat inclined to charitable and social
notoriety, with a fondness for opening bazaars and playing the Lady
Bountiful. She was a most generous woman, and possessed a considerable
fortune of her own.

Their country-place, Styles Court, had been purchased by Mr. Cavendish
early in their married life. He had been completely under his wife‚Äôs
ascendancy, so much so that, on dying, he left the place to her for her
lifetime, as well as the larger part of his income; an arrangement that
was distinctly unfair to his two sons. Their step-mother, however, had
always been most generous to them; indeed, they were so young at the
time of their father‚Äôs remarriage that they always thought of her as
their own mother.

Lawrence, the younger, had been a delicate youth. He had qualified as a
doctor but early relinquished the profession of medicine, and lived at
home while pursuing literary ambitions; though his verses never had any
marked success.

John practised for some time as a barrister, but had finally settled
down to the more congenial life of a country squire. He had married two
years ago, and had taken his wife to live at Styles, though I
entertained a shrewd suspicion that he would have preferred his mother
to increase his allowance, which would have enabled him to have a home
of his own. Mrs. Cavendish, however, was a lady who liked to make her
own plans, and expected other people to fall in with them, and in this
case she certainly had the whip hand, namely: the purse strings.

John noticed my surprise at the news of his mother‚Äôs remarriage and
smiled rather ruefully.
[7m--More--(1%)[27m[K
‚ÄúRotten little bounder too!‚Äù he said savagely. ‚ÄúI can tell you,
Hastings, it‚Äôs making life jolly difficult for us. As for Evie‚Äîyou
remember Evie?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I suppose she was after your time. She‚Äôs the mater‚Äôs factotum,
companion, Jack of all trades! A great sport‚Äîold Evie! Not precisely
young and beautiful, but as game as they make them.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou were going to say‚Äî‚Äî?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, this fellow! He turned up from nowhere, on the pretext of being a
second cousin or something of Evie‚Äôs, though she didn‚Äôt seem
particularly keen to acknowledge the relationship. The fellow is an
absolute outsider, anyone can see that. He‚Äôs got a great black beard,
and wears patent leather boots in all weathers! But the mater cottoned
to him at once, took him on as secretary‚Äîyou know how she‚Äôs always
running a hundred societies?‚Äù

I nodded.

‚ÄúWell, of course the war has turned the hundreds into thousands. No
doubt the fellow was very useful to her. But you could have knocked us
all down with a feather when, three months ago, she suddenly announced
that she and Alfred were engaged! The fellow must be at least twenty
years younger than she is! It‚Äôs simply bare-faced fortune hunting; but
there you are‚Äîshe is her own mistress, and she‚Äôs married him.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt must be a difficult situation for you all.‚Äù

‚ÄúDifficult! It‚Äôs damnable!‚Äù

Thus it came about that, three days later, I descended from the train
at Styles St. Mary, an absurd little station, with no apparent reason
for existence, perched up in the midst of green fields and country
lanes. John Cavendish was waiting on the platform, and piloted me out
to the car.

‚ÄúGot a drop or two of petrol still, you see,‚Äù he remarked. ‚ÄúMainly
owing to the mater‚Äôs activities.‚Äù

The village of Styles St. Mary was situated about two miles from the
little station, and Styles Court lay a mile the other side of it. It
was a still, warm day in early July. As one looked out over the flat
Essex country, lying so green and peaceful under the afternoon sun, it
seemed almost impossible to believe that, not so very far away, a great
war was running its appointed course. I felt I had suddenly strayed
into another world. As we turned in at the lodge gates, John said:

‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid you‚Äôll find it very quiet down here, Hastings.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy dear fellow, that‚Äôs just what I want.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs pleasant enough if you want to lead the idle life. I drill
with the volunteers twice a week, and lend a hand at the farms. My wife
works regularly ‚Äòon the land‚Äô. She is up at five every morning to milk,
and keeps at it steadily until lunchtime. It‚Äôs a jolly good life taking
it all round‚Äîif it weren‚Äôt for that fellow Alfred Inglethorp!‚Äù He
checked the car suddenly, and glanced at his watch. ‚ÄúI wonder if we‚Äôve
[7m--More--(2%)[27mtime to pick up Cynthia. No, she‚Äôll have started from the hospital by
now.‚Äù

‚ÄúCynthia! That‚Äôs not your wife?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, Cynthia is a prot√©g√©e of my mother‚Äôs, the daughter of an old
schoolfellow of hers, who married a rascally solicitor. He came a
cropper, and the girl was left an orphan and penniless. My mother came
to the rescue, and Cynthia has been with us nearly two years now. She
works in the Red Cross Hospital at Tadminster, seven miles away.‚Äù

As he spoke the last words, we drew up in front of the fine old house.
A lady in a stout tweed skirt, who was bending over a flower bed,
straightened herself at our approach.

‚ÄúHullo, Evie, here‚Äôs our wounded hero! Mr. Hastings‚ÄîMiss Howard.‚Äù

Miss Howard shook hands with a hearty, almost painful, grip. I had an
impression of very blue eyes in a sunburnt face. She was a
pleasant-looking woman of about forty, with a deep voice, almost manly
in its stentorian tones, and had a large sensible square body, with
feet to match‚Äîthese last encased in good thick boots. Her conversation,
I soon found, was couched in the telegraphic style.

‚ÄúWeeds grow like house afire. Can‚Äôt keep even with ‚Äôem. Shall press you
in. Better be careful.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure I shall be only too delighted to make myself useful,‚Äù I
responded.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt say it. Never does. Wish you hadn‚Äôt later.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a cynic, Evie,‚Äù said John, laughing. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs tea to-day‚Äîinside
or out?‚Äù

‚ÄúOut. Too fine a day to be cooped up in the house.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on then, you‚Äôve done enough gardening for to-day. ‚ÄòThe labourer
is worthy of his hire‚Äô, you know. Come and be refreshed.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù said Miss Howard, drawing off her gardening gloves, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm
inclined to agree with you.‚Äù

She led the way round the house to where tea was spread under the shade
of a large sycamore.

A figure rose from one of the basket chairs, and came a few steps to
meet us.

‚ÄúMy wife, Hastings,‚Äù said John.

I shall never forget my first sight of Mary Cavendish. Her tall,
slender form, outlined against the bright light; the vivid sense of
slumbering fire that seemed to find expression only in those wonderful
tawny eyes of hers, remarkable eyes, different from any other woman‚Äôs
that I have ever known; the intense power of stillness she possessed,
which nevertheless conveyed the impression of a wild untamed spirit in
an exquisitely civilised body‚Äîall these things are burnt into my
memory. I shall never forget them.

She greeted me with a few words of pleasant welcome in a low clear
[7m--More--(2%)[27mvoice, and I sank into a basket chair feeling distinctly glad that I
had accepted John‚Äôs invitation. Mrs. Cavendish gave me some tea, and
her few quiet remarks heightened my first impression of her as a
thoroughly fascinating woman. An appreciative listener is always
stimulating, and I described, in a humorous manner, certain incidents
of my Convalescent Home, in a way which, I flatter myself, greatly
amused my hostess. John, of course, good fellow though he is, could
hardly be called a brilliant conversationalist.

At that moment a well remembered voice floated through the open French
window near at hand:

‚ÄúThen you‚Äôll write to the Princess after tea, Alfred? I‚Äôll write to
Lady Tadminster for the second day, myself. Or shall we wait until we
hear from the Princess? In case of a refusal, Lady Tadminster might
open it the first day, and Mrs. Crosbie the second. Then there‚Äôs the
Duchess‚Äîabout the school f√™te.‚Äù

There was the murmur of a man‚Äôs voice, and then Mrs. Inglethorp‚Äôs rose
in reply:

‚ÄúYes, certainly. After tea will do quite well. You are so thoughtful,
Alfred dear.‚Äù

The French window swung open a little wider, and a handsome
white-haired old lady, with a somewhat masterful cast of features,
stepped out of it on to the lawn. A man followed her, a suggestion of
deference in his manner.

Mrs. Inglethorp greeted me with effusion.

‚ÄúWhy, if it isn‚Äôt too delightful to see you again, Mr. Hastings, after
all these years. Alfred, darling, Mr. Hastings‚Äîmy husband.‚Äù

I looked with some curiosity at ‚ÄúAlfred darling‚Äù. He certainly struck a
rather alien note. I did not wonder at John objecting to his beard. It
was one of the longest and blackest I have ever seen. He wore
gold-rimmed pince-nez, and had a curious impassivity of feature. It
struck me that he might look natural on a stage, but was strangely out
of place in real life. His voice was rather deep and unctuous. He
placed a wooden hand in mine and said:

‚ÄúThis is a pleasure, Mr. Hastings.‚Äù Then, turning to his wife: ‚ÄúEmily
dearest, I think that cushion is a little damp.‚Äù

She beamed fondly on him, as he substituted another with every
demonstration of the tenderest care. Strange infatuation of an
otherwise sensible woman!

With the presence of Mr. Inglethorp, a sense of constraint and veiled
hostility seemed to settle down upon the company. Miss Howard, in
particular, took no pains to conceal her feelings. Mrs. Inglethorp,
however, seemed to notice nothing unusual. Her volubility, which I
remembered of old, had lost nothing in the intervening years, and she
poured out a steady flood of conversation, mainly on the subject of the
forthcoming bazaar which she was organizing and which was to take place
shortly. Occasionally she referred to her husband over a question of
days or dates. His watchful and attentive manner never varied. From the
very first I took a firm and rooted dislike to him, and I flatter
myself that my first judgments are usually fairly shrewd.

[7m--More--(3%)[27mPresently Mrs. Inglethorp turned to give some instructions about
letters to Evelyn Howard, and her husband addressed me in his
painstaking voice:

‚ÄúIs soldiering your regular profession, Mr. Hastings?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, before the war I was in Lloyd‚Äôs.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you will return there after it is over?‚Äù

‚ÄúPerhaps. Either that or a fresh start altogether.‚Äù

Mary Cavendish leant forward.

‚ÄúWhat would you really choose as a profession, if you could just
consult your inclination?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, that depends.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo secret hobby?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúTell me‚Äîyou‚Äôre drawn to something?
Everyone is‚Äîusually something absurd.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll laugh at me.‚Äù

She smiled.

‚ÄúPerhaps.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôve always had a secret hankering to be a detective!‚Äù

‚ÄúThe real thing‚ÄîScotland Yard? Or Sherlock Holmes?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, Sherlock Holmes by all means. But really, seriously, I am awfully
drawn to it. I came across a man in Belgium once, a very famous
detective, and he quite inflamed me. He was a marvellous little fellow.
He used to say that all good detective work was a mere matter of
method. My system is based on his‚Äîthough of course I have progressed
rather further. He was a funny little man, a great dandy, but
wonderfully clever.‚Äù

‚ÄúLike a good detective story myself,‚Äù remarked Miss Howard. ‚ÄúLots of
nonsense written, though. Criminal discovered in last chapter. Everyone
dumbfounded. Real crime‚Äîyou‚Äôd know at once.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere have been a great number of undiscovered crimes,‚Äù I argued.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt mean the police, but the people that are right in it. The
family. You couldn‚Äôt really hoodwink them. They‚Äôd know.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen,‚Äù I said, much amused, ‚Äúyou think that if you were mixed up in a
crime, say a murder, you‚Äôd be able to spot the murderer right off?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course I should. Mightn‚Äôt be able to prove it to a pack of lawyers.
But I‚Äôm certain I‚Äôd know. I‚Äôd feel it in my fingertips if he came near
me.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt might be a ‚Äòshe‚Äô,‚Äù I suggested.

‚ÄúMight. But murder‚Äôs a violent crime. Associate it more with a man.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot in a case of poisoning.‚Äù Mrs. Cavendish‚Äôs clear voice startled me.
[7m--More--(4%)[27m‚ÄúDr. Bauerstein was saying yesterday that, owing to the general
ignorance of the more uncommon poisons among the medical profession,
there were probably countless cases of poisoning quite unsuspected.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy, Mary, what a gruesome conversation!‚Äù cried Mrs. Inglethorp. ‚ÄúIt
makes me feel as if a goose were walking over my grave. Oh, there‚Äôs
Cynthia!‚Äù

A young girl in V.A.D. uniform ran lightly across the lawn.

‚ÄúWhy, Cynthia, you are late to-day. This is Mr. Hastings‚ÄîMiss Murdoch.‚Äù

Cynthia Murdoch was a fresh-looking young creature, full of life and
vigour. She tossed off her little V.A.D. cap, and I admired the great
loose waves of her auburn hair, and the smallness and whiteness of the
hand she held out to claim her tea. With dark eyes and eyelashes she
would have been a beauty.

She flung herself down on the ground beside John, and as I handed her a
plate of sandwiches she smiled up at me.

‚ÄúSit down here on the grass, do. It‚Äôs ever so much nicer.‚Äù

I dropped down obediently.

‚ÄúYou work at Tadminster, don‚Äôt you, Miss Murdoch?‚Äù

She nodded.

‚ÄúFor my sins.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo they bully you, then?‚Äù I asked, smiling.

‚ÄúI should like to see them!‚Äù cried Cynthia with dignity.

‚ÄúI have got a cousin who is nursing,‚Äù I remarked. ‚ÄúAnd she is terrified
of ‚ÄòSisters‚Äô.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt wonder. Sisters _are_, you know, Mr. Hastings. They simp-ly
_are_! You‚Äôve no idea! But I‚Äôm not a nurse, thank heaven, I work in the
dispensary.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow many people do you poison?‚Äù I asked, smiling.

Cynthia smiled too.

‚ÄúOh, hundreds!‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúCynthia,‚Äù called Mrs. Inglethorp, ‚Äúdo you think you could write a few
notes for me?‚Äù

‚ÄúCertainly, Aunt Emily.‚Äù

She jumped up promptly, and something in her manner reminded me that
her position was a dependent one, and that Mrs. Inglethorp, kind as she
might be in the main, did not allow her to forget it.

My hostess turned to me.

‚ÄúJohn will show you your room. Supper is at half-past seven. We have
given up late dinner for some time now. Lady Tadminster, our Member‚Äôs
[7m--More--(4%)[27mwife‚Äîshe was the late Lord Abbotsbury‚Äôs daughter‚Äîdoes the same. She
agrees with me that one must set an example of economy. We are quite a
war household; nothing is wasted here‚Äîevery scrap of waste paper, even,
is saved and sent away in sacks.‚Äù

I expressed my appreciation, and John took me into the house and up the
broad staircase, which forked right and left half-way to different
wings of the building. My room was in the left wing, and looked out
over the park.

John left me, and a few minutes later I saw him from my window walking
slowly across the grass arm in arm with Cynthia Murdoch. I heard Mrs.
Inglethorp call ‚ÄúCynthia‚Äù impatiently, and the girl started and ran
back to the house. At the same moment, a man stepped out from the
shadow of a tree and walked slowly in the same direction. He looked
about forty, very dark with a melancholy clean-shaven face. Some
violent emotion seemed to be mastering him. He looked up at my window
as he passed, and I recognized him, though he had changed much in the
fifteen years that had elapsed since we last met. It was John‚Äôs younger
brother, Lawrence Cavendish. I wondered what it was that had brought
that singular expression to his face.

Then I dismissed him from my mind, and returned to the contemplation of
my own affairs.

The evening passed pleasantly enough; and I dreamed that night of that
enigmatical woman, Mary Cavendish.

The next morning dawned bright and sunny, and I was full of the
anticipation of a delightful visit.

I did not see Mrs. Cavendish until lunch-time, when she volunteered to
take me for a walk, and we spent a charming afternoon roaming in the
woods, returning to the house about five.

As we entered the large hall, John beckoned us both into the
smoking-room. I saw at once by his face that something disturbing had
occurred. We followed him in, and he shut the door after us.

‚ÄúLook here, Mary, there‚Äôs the deuce of a mess. Evie‚Äôs had a row with
Alfred Inglethorp, and she‚Äôs off.‚Äù

‚ÄúEvie? Off?‚Äù

John nodded gloomily.

‚ÄúYes; you see she went to the mater, and‚ÄîOh,‚Äîhere‚Äôs Evie herself.‚Äù

Miss Howard entered. Her lips were set grimly together, and she carried
a small suit-case. She looked excited and determined, and slightly on
the defensive.

‚ÄúAt any rate,‚Äù she burst out, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve spoken my mind!‚Äù

‚ÄúMy dear Evelyn,‚Äù cried Mrs. Cavendish, ‚Äúthis can‚Äôt be true!‚Äù

Miss Howard nodded grimly.

‚ÄúTrue enough! Afraid I said some things to Emily she won‚Äôt forget or
forgive in a hurry. Don‚Äôt mind if they‚Äôve only sunk in a bit. Probably
water off a duck‚Äôs back, though. I said right out: ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre an old
[7m--More--(5%)[27mwoman, Emily, and there‚Äôs no fool like an old fool. The man‚Äôs twenty
years younger than you, and don‚Äôt you fool yourself as to what he
married you for. Money! Well, don‚Äôt let him have too much of it. Farmer
Raikes has got a very pretty young wife. Just ask your Alfred how much
time he spends over there.‚Äô She was very angry. Natural! I went on,
‚ÄòI‚Äôm going to warn you, whether you like it or not. That man would as
soon murder you in your bed as look at you. He‚Äôs a bad lot. You can say
what you like to me, but remember what I‚Äôve told you. He‚Äôs a bad lot!‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat did she say?‚Äù

Miss Howard made an extremely expressive grimace.

‚Äú‚ÄòDarling Alfred‚Äô‚Äî‚Äòdearest Alfred‚Äô‚Äî‚Äòwicked calumnies‚Äô ‚Äî‚Äòwicked
lies‚Äô‚Äî‚Äòwicked woman‚Äô‚Äîto accuse her ‚Äòdear husband!‚Äô The sooner I left
her house the better. So I‚Äôm off.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut not now?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis minute!‚Äù

For a moment we sat and stared at her. Finally John Cavendish, finding
his persuasions of no avail, went off to look up the trains. His wife
followed him, murmuring something about persuading Mrs. Inglethorp to
think better of it.

As she left the room, Miss Howard‚Äôs face changed. She leant towards me
eagerly.

‚ÄúMr. Hastings, you‚Äôre honest. I can trust you?‚Äù

I was a little startled. She laid her hand on my arm, and sank her
voice to a whisper.

‚ÄúLook after her, Mr. Hastings. My poor Emily. They‚Äôre a lot of
sharks‚Äîall of them. Oh, I know what I‚Äôm talking about. There isn‚Äôt one
of them that‚Äôs not hard up and trying to get money out of her. I‚Äôve
protected her as much as I could. Now I‚Äôm out of the way, they‚Äôll
impose upon her.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course, Miss Howard,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do everything I can, but I‚Äôm
sure you‚Äôre excited and overwrought.‚Äù

She interrupted me by slowly shaking her forefinger.

‚ÄúYoung man, trust me. I‚Äôve lived in the world rather longer than you
have. All I ask you is to keep your eyes open. You‚Äôll see what I mean.‚Äù

The throb of the motor came through the open window, and Miss Howard
rose and moved to the door. John‚Äôs voice sounded outside. With her hand
on the handle, she turned her head over her shoulder, and beckoned to
me.

‚ÄúAbove all, Mr. Hastings, watch that devil‚Äîher husband!‚Äù

There was no time for more. Miss Howard was swallowed up in an eager
chorus of protests and good-byes. The Inglethorps did not appear.

As the motor drove away, Mrs. Cavendish suddenly detached herself from
the group, and moved across the drive to the lawn to meet a tall
bearded man who had been evidently making for the house. The colour
[7m--More--(6%)[27mrose in her cheeks as she held out her hand to him.

‚ÄúWho is that?‚Äù I asked sharply, for instinctively I distrusted the man.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs Dr. Bauerstein,‚Äù said John shortly.

‚ÄúAnd who is Dr. Bauerstein?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs staying in the village doing a rest cure, after a bad nervous
breakdown. He‚Äôs a London specialist; a very clever man‚Äîone of the
greatest living experts on poisons, I believe.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd he‚Äôs a great friend of Mary‚Äôs,‚Äù put in Cynthia, the irrepressible.

John Cavendish frowned and changed the subject.

‚ÄúCome for a stroll, Hastings. This has been a most rotten business. She
always had a rough tongue, but there is no stauncher friend in England
than Evelyn Howard.‚Äù

He took the path through the plantation, and we walked down to the
village through the woods which bordered one side of the estate.

As we passed through one of the gates on our way home again, a pretty
young woman of gipsy type coming in the opposite direction bowed and
smiled.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a pretty girl,‚Äù I remarked appreciatively.

John‚Äôs face hardened.

‚ÄúThat is Mrs. Raikes.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe one that Miss Howard‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly,‚Äù said John, with rather unnecessary abruptness.

I thought of the white-haired old lady in the big house, and that vivid
wicked little face that had just smiled into ours, and a vague chill of
foreboding crept over me. I brushed it aside.

‚ÄúStyles is really a glorious old place,‚Äù I said to John.

He nodded rather gloomily.

‚ÄúYes, it‚Äôs a fine property. It‚Äôll be mine some day‚Äîshould be mine now
by rights, if my father had only made a decent will. And then I
shouldn‚Äôt be so damned hard up as I am now.‚Äù

‚ÄúHard up, are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy dear Hastings, I don‚Äôt mind telling you that I‚Äôm at my wits‚Äô end
for money.‚Äù

‚ÄúCouldn‚Äôt your brother help you?‚Äù

‚ÄúLawrence? He‚Äôs gone through every penny he ever had, publishing rotten
verses in fancy bindings. No, we‚Äôre an impecunious lot. My mother‚Äôs
always been awfully good to us, I must say. That is, up to now. Since
her marriage, of course‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù he broke off, frowning.

[7m--More--(6%)[27mFor the first time I felt that, with Evelyn Howard, something
indefinable had gone from the atmosphere. Her presence had spelt
security. Now that security was removed‚Äîand the air seemed rife with
suspicion. The sinister face of Dr. Bauerstein recurred to me
unpleasantly. A vague suspicion of everyone and everything filled my
mind. Just for a moment I had a premonition of approaching evil.






CHAPTER II. THE 16TH AND 17TH OF JULY

I had arrived at Styles on the 5th of July. I come now to the events of
the 16th and 17th of that month. For the convenience of the reader I
will recapitulate the incidents of those days in as exact a manner as
possible. They were elicited subsequently at the trial by a process of
long and tedious cross-examinations.

I received a letter from Evelyn Howard a couple of days after her
departure, telling me she was working as a nurse at the big hospital in
Middlingham, a manufacturing town some fifteen miles away, and begging
me to let her know if Mrs. Inglethorp should show any wish to be
reconciled.

The only fly in the ointment of my peaceful days was Mrs. Cavendish‚Äôs
extraordinary, and, for my part, unaccountable preference for the
society of Dr. Bauerstein. What she saw in the man I cannot imagine,
but she was always asking him up to the house, and often went off for
long expeditions with him. I must confess that I was quite unable to
see his attraction.

The 16th of July fell on a Monday. It was a day of turmoil. The famous
bazaar had taken place on Saturday, and an entertainment, in connection
with the same charity, at which Mrs. Inglethorp was to recite a War
poem, was to be held that night. We were all busy during the morning
arranging and decorating the Hall in the village where it was to take
place. We had a late luncheon and spent the afternoon resting in the
garden. I noticed that John‚Äôs manner was somewhat unusual. He seemed
very excited and restless.

After tea, Mrs. Inglethorp went to lie down to rest before her efforts
in the evening and I challenged Mary Cavendish to a single at tennis.

About a quarter to seven, Mrs. Inglethorp called us that we should be
late as supper was early that night. We had rather a scramble to get
ready in time; and before the meal was over the motor was waiting at
the door.

The entertainment was a great success, Mrs. Inglethorp‚Äôs recitation
receiving tremendous applause. There were also some tableaux in which
Cynthia took part. She did not return with us, having been asked to a
supper party, and to remain the night with some friends who had been
acting with her in the tableaux.

The following morning, Mrs. Inglethorp stayed in bed to breakfast, as
she was rather overtired; but she appeared in her briskest mood about
12.30, and swept Lawrence and myself off to a luncheon party.

‚ÄúSuch a charming invitation from Mrs. Rolleston. Lady Tadminster‚Äôs
[7m--More--(7%)[27msister, you know. The Rollestons came over with the Conqueror‚Äîone of
our oldest families.‚Äù

Mary had excused herself on the plea of an engagement with Dr.
Bauerstein.

We had a pleasant luncheon, and as we drove away Lawrence suggested
that we should return by Tadminster, which was barely a mile out of our
way, and pay a visit to Cynthia in her dispensary. Mrs. Inglethorp
replied that this was an excellent idea, but as she had several letters
to write she would drop us there, and we could come back with Cynthia
in the pony-trap.

We were detained under suspicion by the hospital porter, until Cynthia
appeared to vouch for us, looking very cool and sweet in her long white
overall. She took us up to her sanctum, and introduced us to her fellow
dispenser, a rather awe-inspiring individual, whom Cynthia cheerily
addressed as ‚ÄúNibs.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat a lot of bottles!‚Äù I exclaimed, as my eye travelled round the
small room. ‚ÄúDo you really know what‚Äôs in them all?‚Äù

‚ÄúSay something original,‚Äù groaned Cynthia. ‚ÄúEvery single person who
comes up here says that. We are really thinking of bestowing a prize on
the first individual who does _not_ say: ‚ÄòWhat a lot of bottles!‚Äô And I
know the next thing you‚Äôre going to say is: ‚ÄòHow many people have you
poisoned?‚Äô‚Äù

I pleaded guilty with a laugh.

‚ÄúIf you people only knew how fatally easy it is to poison someone by
mistake, you wouldn‚Äôt joke about it. Come on, let‚Äôs have tea. We‚Äôve got
all sorts of secret stories in that cupboard. No, Lawrence‚Äîthat‚Äôs the
poison cupboard. The big cupboard‚Äîthat‚Äôs right.‚Äù

We had a very cheery tea, and assisted Cynthia to wash up afterwards.
We had just put away the last tea-spoon when a knock came at the door.
The countenances of Cynthia and Nibs were suddenly petrified into a
stern and forbidding expression.

‚ÄúCome in,‚Äù said Cynthia, in a sharp professional tone.

A young and rather scared looking nurse appeared with a bottle which
she proffered to Nibs, who waved her towards Cynthia with the somewhat
enigmatical remark:

‚Äú_I_‚Äôm not really here to-day.‚Äù

Cynthia took the bottle and examined it with the severity of a judge.

‚ÄúThis should have been sent up this morning.‚Äù

‚ÄúSister is very sorry. She forgot.‚Äù

‚ÄúSister should read the rules outside the door.‚Äù

I gathered from the little nurse‚Äôs expression that there was not the
least likelihood of her having the hardihood to retail this message to
the dreaded ‚ÄúSister‚Äù.

‚ÄúSo now it can‚Äôt be done until to-morrow,‚Äù finished Cynthia.
[7m--More--(8%)[27m[K
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you think you could possibly let us have it to-night?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù said Cynthia graciously, ‚Äúwe are very busy, but if we have time
it shall be done.‚Äù

The little nurse withdrew, and Cynthia promptly took a jar from the
shelf, refilled the bottle, and placed it on the table outside the
door.

I laughed.

‚ÄúDiscipline must be maintained?‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly. Come out on our little balcony. You can see all the outside
wards there.‚Äù

I followed Cynthia and her friend and they pointed out the different
wards to me. Lawrence remained behind, but after a few moments Cynthia
called to him over her shoulder to come and join us. Then she looked at
her watch.

‚ÄúNothing more to do, Nibs?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúAll right. Then we can lock up and go.‚Äù

I had seen Lawrence in quite a different light that afternoon. Compared
to John, he was an astoundingly difficult person to get to know. He was
the opposite of his brother in almost every respect, being unusually
shy and reserved. Yet he had a certain charm of manner, and I fancied
that, if one really knew him well, one could have a deep affection for
him. I had always fancied that his manner to Cynthia was rather
constrained, and that she on her side was inclined to be shy of him.
But they were both gay enough this afternoon, and chatted together like
a couple of children.

As we drove through the village, I remembered that I wanted some
stamps, so accordingly we pulled up at the post office.

As I came out again, I cannoned into a little man who was just
entering. I drew aside and apologised, when suddenly, with a loud
exclamation, he clasped me in his arms and kissed me warmly.

‚Äú_Mon ami_ Hastings!‚Äù he cried. ‚ÄúIt is indeed _mon ami_ Hastings!‚Äù

‚ÄúPoirot!‚Äù I exclaimed.

I turned to the pony-trap.

‚ÄúThis is a very pleasant meeting for me, Miss Cynthia. This is my old
friend, Monsieur Poirot, whom I have not seen for years.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, we know Monsieur Poirot,‚Äù said Cynthia gaily. ‚ÄúBut I had no idea
he was a friend of yours.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, indeed,‚Äù said Poirot seriously. ‚ÄúI know Mademoiselle Cynthia. It
is by the charity of that good Mrs. Inglethorp that I am here.‚Äù Then,
as I looked at him inquiringly: ‚ÄúYes, my friend, she had kindly
extended hospitality to seven of my countrypeople who, alas, are
[7m--More--(9%)[27mrefugees from their native land. We Belgians will always remember her
with gratitude.‚Äù

Poirot was an extraordinary looking little man. He was hardly more than
five feet, four inches, but carried himself with great dignity. His
head was exactly the shape of an egg, and he always perched it a little
on one side. His moustache was very stiff and military. The neatness of
his attire was almost incredible. I believe a speck of dust would have
caused him more pain than a bullet wound. Yet this quaint dandified
little man who, I was sorry to see, now limped badly, had been in his
time one of the most celebrated members of the Belgian police. As a
detective, his _flair_ had been extraordinary, and he had achieved
triumphs by unravelling some of the most baffling cases of the day.

He pointed out to me the little house inhabited by him and his fellow
Belgians, and I promised to go and see him at an early date. Then he
raised his hat with a flourish to Cynthia, and we drove away.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a dear little man,‚Äù said Cynthia. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd no idea you knew him.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been entertaining a celebrity unawares,‚Äù I replied.

And, for the rest of the way home, I recited to them the various
exploits and triumphs of Hercule Poirot.

We arrived back in a very cheerful mood. As we entered the hall, Mrs.
Inglethorp came out of her boudoir. She looked flushed and upset.

‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs you,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúIs there anything the matter, Aunt Emily?‚Äù asked Cynthia.

‚ÄúCertainly not,‚Äù said Mrs. Inglethorp sharply. ‚ÄúWhat should there be?‚Äù
Then catching sight of Dorcas, the parlourmaid, going into the
dining-room, she called to her to bring some stamps into the boudoir.

‚ÄúYes, m‚Äôm.‚Äù The old servant hesitated, then added diffidently: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt
you think, m‚Äôm, you‚Äôd better get to bed? You‚Äôre looking very tired.‚Äù

‚ÄúPerhaps you‚Äôre right, Dorcas‚Äîyes‚Äîno‚Äînot now. I‚Äôve some letters I must
finish by post-time. Have you lighted the fire in my room as I told
you?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, m‚Äôm.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll go to bed directly after supper.‚Äù

She went into the boudoir again, and Cynthia stared after her.

‚ÄúGoodness gracious! I wonder what‚Äôs up?‚Äù she said to Lawrence.

He did not seem to have heard her, for without a word he turned on his
heel and went out of the house.

I suggested a quick game of tennis before supper and, Cynthia agreeing,
I ran upstairs to fetch my racquet.

Mrs. Cavendish was coming down the stairs. It may have been my fancy,
but she, too, was looking odd and disturbed.

‚ÄúHad a good walk with Dr. Bauerstein?‚Äù I asked, trying to appear as
[7m--More--(9%)[27mindifferent as I could.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt go,‚Äù she replied abruptly. ‚ÄúWhere is Mrs. Inglethorp?‚Äù

‚ÄúIn the boudoir.‚Äù

Her hand clenched itself on the banisters, then she seemed to nerve
herself for some encounter, and went rapidly past me down the stairs
across the hall to the boudoir, the door of which she shut behind her.

As I ran out to the tennis court a few moments later, I had to pass the
open boudoir window, and was unable to help overhearing the following
scrap of dialogue. Mary Cavendish was saying in the voice of a woman
desperately controlling herself:

‚ÄúThen you won‚Äôt show it to me?‚Äù

To which Mrs. Inglethorp replied:

‚ÄúMy dear Mary, it has nothing to do with that matter.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen show it to me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI tell you it is not what you imagine. It does not concern you in the
least.‚Äù

To which Mary Cavendish replied, with a rising bitterness:

‚ÄúOf course, I might have known you would shield him.‚Äù

Cynthia was waiting for me, and greeted me eagerly with:

‚ÄúI say! There‚Äôs been the most awful row! I‚Äôve got it all out of
Dorcas.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat kind of a row?‚Äù

‚ÄúBetween Aunt Emily and _him_. I do hope she‚Äôs found him out at last!‚Äù

‚ÄúWas Dorcas there, then?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course not. She ‚Äòhappened to be near the door‚Äô. It was a real old
bust-up. I do wish I knew what it was all about.‚Äù

I thought of Mrs. Raikes‚Äôs gipsy face, and Evelyn Howard‚Äôs warnings,
but wisely decided to hold my peace, whilst Cynthia exhausted every
possible hypothesis, and cheerfully hoped, ‚ÄúAunt Emily will send him
away, and will never speak to him again.‚Äù

I was anxious to get hold of John, but he was nowhere to be seen.
Evidently something very momentous had occurred that afternoon. I tried
to forget the few words I had overheard; but, do what I would, I could
not dismiss them altogether from my mind. What was Mary Cavendish‚Äôs
concern in the matter?

Mr. Inglethorp was in the drawing-room when I came down to supper. His
face was impassive as ever, and the strange unreality of the man struck
me afresh.

Mrs. Inglethorp came down last. She still looked agitated, and during
the meal there was a somewhat constrained silence. Inglethorp was
[7m--More--(10%)[27munusually quiet. As a rule, he surrounded his wife with little
attentions, placing a cushion at her back, and altogether playing the
part of the devoted husband. Immediately after supper, Mrs. Inglethorp
retired to her boudoir again.

‚ÄúSend my coffee in here, Mary,‚Äù she called. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve just five minutes to
catch the post.‚Äù

Cynthia and I went and sat by the open window in the drawing-room. Mary
Cavendish brought our coffee to us. She seemed excited.

‚ÄúDo you young people want lights, or do you enjoy the twilight?‚Äù she
asked. ‚ÄúWill you take Mrs. Inglethorp her coffee, Cynthia? I will pour
it out.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo not trouble, Mary,‚Äù said Inglethorp. ‚ÄúI will take it to Emily.‚Äù He
poured it out, and went out of the room carrying it carefully.

Lawrence followed him, and Mrs. Cavendish sat down by us.

We three sat for some time in silence. It was a glorious night, hot and
still. Mrs. Cavendish fanned herself gently with a palm leaf.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost too hot,‚Äù she murmured. ‚ÄúWe shall have a thunderstorm.‚Äù

Alas, that these harmonious moments can never endure! My paradise was
rudely shattered by the sound of a well known, and heartily disliked,
voice in the hall.

‚ÄúDr. Bauerstein!‚Äù exclaimed Cynthia. ‚ÄúWhat a funny time to come.‚Äù

I glanced jealously at Mary Cavendish, but she seemed quite
undisturbed, the delicate pallor of her cheeks did not vary.

In a few moments, Alfred Inglethorp had ushered the doctor in, the
latter laughing, and protesting that he was in no fit state for a
drawing-room. In truth, he presented a sorry spectacle, being literally
plastered with mud.

‚ÄúWhat have you been doing, doctor?‚Äù cried Mrs. Cavendish.

‚ÄúI must make my apologies,‚Äù said the doctor. ‚ÄúI did not really mean to
come in, but Mr. Inglethorp insisted.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, Bauerstein, you are in a plight,‚Äù said John, strolling in from
the hall. ‚ÄúHave some coffee, and tell us what you have been up to.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you, I will.‚Äù He laughed rather ruefully, as he described how he
had discovered a very rare species of fern in an inaccessible place,
and in his efforts to obtain it had lost his footing, and slipped
ignominiously into a neighbouring pond.

‚ÄúThe sun soon dried me off,‚Äù he added, ‚Äúbut I‚Äôm afraid my appearance is
very disreputable.‚Äù

At this juncture, Mrs. Inglethorp called to Cynthia from the hall, and
the girl ran out.

‚ÄúJust carry up my despatch-case, will you, dear? I‚Äôm going to bed.‚Äù

The door into the hall was a wide one. I had risen when Cynthia did,

the intense interest aroused in the public by what was known at the
time as ‚Äúthe styles case‚Äù has now somewhat subsided. nevertheless, in
[7m--More--(0%)[27mview of the world-wide notoriety which attended it, i have been asked,
both by my friend poirot and the family themselves, to write an account
of the whole story. this, we trust, will effectually silence the
sensational rumours which still persist.

i will therefore briefly set down the circumstances which led to my
being connected with the affair.

i had been invalided home from the front; and, after spending some
months in a rather depressing convalescent home, was given a month‚Äôs
sick leave. having no near relations or friends, i was trying to make
up my mind what to do, when i ran across john cavendish. i had seen
very little of him for some years. indeed, i had never known him
particularly well. he was a good fifteen years my senior, for one
thing, though he hardly looked his forty-five years. as a boy, though,
i had often stayed at styles, his mother‚Äôs place in essex.

we had a good yarn about old times, and it ended in his inviting me
down to styles to spend my leave there.

‚Äúthe mater will be delighted to see you again‚Äîafter all those years,‚Äù
he added.

‚Äúyour mother keeps well?‚Äù i asked.

‚Äúoh, yes. i suppose you know that she has married again?‚Äù

i am afraid i showed my surprise rather plainly. mrs. cavendish, who
had married john‚Äôs father when he was a widower with two sons, had been
a handsome woman of middle-age as i remembered her. she certainly could
not be a day less than seventy now. i recalled her as an energetic,
autocratic personality, somewhat inclined to charitable and social
notoriety, with a fondness for opening bazaars and playing the lady
bountiful. she was a most generous woman, and possessed a considerable
fortune of her own.

their country-place, styles court, had been purchased by mr. cavendish
early in their married life. he had been completely under his wife‚Äôs
ascendancy, so much so that, on dying, he left the place to her for her
lifetime, as well as the larger part of his income; an arrangement that
was distinctly unfair to his two sons. their step-mother, however, had
always been most generous to them; indeed, they were so young at the
time of their father‚Äôs remarriage that they always thought of her as
their own mother.

lawrence, the younger, had been a delicate youth. he had qualified as a
doctor but early relinquished the profession of medicine, and lived at
home while pursuing literary ambitions; though his verses never had any
marked success.

john practised for some time as a barrister, but had finally settled
down to the more congenial life of a country squire. he had married two
years ago, and had taken his wife to live at styles, though i
entertained a shrewd suspicion that he would have preferred his mother
to increase his allowance, which would have enabled him to have a home
of his own. mrs. cavendish, however, was a lady who liked to make her
own plans, and expected other people to fall in with them, and in this
case she certainly had the whip hand, namely: the purse strings.

john noticed my surprise at the news of his mother‚Äôs remarriage and
smiled rather ruefully.
[7m--More--(1%)[27m[K
‚Äúrotten little bounder too!‚Äù he said savagely. ‚Äúi can tell you,
hastings, it‚Äôs making life jolly difficult for us. as for evie‚Äîyou
remember evie?‚Äù

‚Äúno.‚Äù

‚Äúoh, i suppose she was after your time. she‚Äôs the mater‚Äôs factotum,
companion, jack of all trades! a great sport‚Äîold evie! not precisely
young and beautiful, but as game as they make them.‚Äù

‚Äúyou were going to say‚Äî‚Äî?‚Äù

‚Äúoh, this fellow! he turned up from nowhere, on the pretext of being a
second cousin or something of evie‚Äôs, though she didn‚Äôt seem
particularly keen to acknowledge the relationship. the fellow is an
absolute outsider, anyone can see that. he‚Äôs got a great black beard,
and wears patent leather boots in all weathers! but the mater cottoned
to him at once, took him on as secretary‚Äîyou know how she‚Äôs always
running a hundred societies?‚Äù

i nodded.

‚Äúwell, of course the war has turned the hundreds into thousands. no
doubt the fellow was very useful to her. but you could have knocked us
all down with a feather when, three months ago, she suddenly announced
that she and alfred were engaged! the fellow must be at least twenty
years younger than she is! it‚Äôs simply bare-faced fortune hunting; but
there you are‚Äîshe is her own mistress, and she‚Äôs married him.‚Äù

‚Äúit must be a difficult situation for you all.‚Äù

‚Äúdifficult! it‚Äôs damnable!‚Äù

thus it came about that, three days later, i descended from the train
at styles st. mary, an absurd little station, with no apparent reason
for existence, perched up in the midst of green fields and country
lanes. john cavendish was waiting on the platform, and piloted me out
to the car.

‚Äúgot a drop or two of petrol still, you see,‚Äù he remarked. ‚Äúmainly
owing to the mater‚Äôs activities.‚Äù

the village of styles st. mary was situated about two miles from the
little station, and styles court lay a mile the other side of it. it
was a still, warm day in early july. as one looked out over the flat
essex country, lying so green and peaceful under the afternoon sun, it
seemed almost impossible to believe that, not so very far away, a great
war was running its appointed course. i felt i had suddenly strayed
into another world. as we turned in at the lodge gates, john said:

‚Äúi‚Äôm afraid you‚Äôll find it very quiet down here, hastings.‚Äù

‚Äúmy dear fellow, that‚Äôs just what i want.‚Äù

‚Äúoh, it‚Äôs pleasant enough if you want to lead the idle life. i drill
with the volunteers twice a week, and lend a hand at the farms. my wife
works regularly ‚Äòon the land‚Äô. she is up at five every morning to milk,
and keeps at it steadily until lunchtime. it‚Äôs a jolly good life taking
it all round‚Äîif it weren‚Äôt for that fellow alfred inglethorp!‚Äù he
checked the car suddenly, and glanced at his watch. ‚Äúi wonder if we‚Äôve
[7m--More--(2%)[27mtime to pick up cynthia. no, she‚Äôll have started from the hospital by
now.‚Äù

‚Äúcynthia! that‚Äôs not your wife?‚Äù

‚Äúno, cynthia is a prot√©g√©e of my mother‚Äôs, the daughter of an old
schoolfellow of hers, who married a rascally solicitor. he came a
cropper, and the girl was left an orphan and penniless. my mother came
to the rescue, and cynthia has been with us nearly two years now. she
works in the red cross hospital at tadminster, seven miles away.‚Äù

as he spoke the last words, we drew up in front of the fine old house.
a lady in a stout tweed skirt, who was bending over a flower bed,
straightened herself at our approach.

‚Äúhullo, evie, here‚Äôs our wounded hero! mr. hastings‚Äîmiss howard.‚Äù

miss howard shook hands with a hearty, almost painful, grip. i had an
impression of very blue eyes in a sunburnt face. she was a
pleasant-looking woman of about forty, with a deep voice, almost manly
in its stentorian tones, and had a large sensible square body, with
feet to match‚Äîthese last encased in good thick boots. her conversation,
i soon found, was couched in the telegraphic style.

‚Äúweeds grow like house afire. can‚Äôt keep even with ‚Äôem. shall press you
in. better be careful.‚Äù

‚Äúi‚Äôm sure i shall be only too delighted to make myself useful,‚Äù i
responded.

‚Äúdon‚Äôt say it. never does. wish you hadn‚Äôt later.‚Äù

‚Äúyou‚Äôre a cynic, evie,‚Äù said john, laughing. ‚Äúwhere‚Äôs tea to-day‚Äîinside
or out?‚Äù

‚Äúout. too fine a day to be cooped up in the house.‚Äù

‚Äúcome on then, you‚Äôve done enough gardening for to-day. ‚Äòthe labourer
is worthy of his hire‚Äô, you know. come and be refreshed.‚Äù

‚Äúwell,‚Äù said miss howard, drawing off her gardening gloves, ‚Äúi‚Äôm
inclined to agree with you.‚Äù

she led the way round the house to where tea was spread under the shade
of a large sycamore.

a figure rose from one of the basket chairs, and came a few steps to
meet us.

‚Äúmy wife, hastings,‚Äù said john.

i shall never forget my first sight of mary cavendish. her tall,
slender form, outlined against the bright light; the vivid sense of
slumbering fire that seemed to find expression only in those wonderful
tawny eyes of hers, remarkable eyes, different from any other woman‚Äôs
that i have ever known; the intense power of stillness she possessed,
which nevertheless conveyed the impression of a wild untamed spirit in
an exquisitely civilised body‚Äîall these things are burnt into my
memory. i shall never forget them.

she greeted me with a few words of pleasant welcome in a low clear
[7m--More--(2%)[27mvoice, and i sank into a basket chair feeling distinctly glad that i
had accepted john‚Äôs invitation. mrs. cavendish gave me some tea, and
her few quiet remarks heightened my first impression of her as a
thoroughly fascinating woman. an appreciative listener is always
stimulating, and i described, in a humorous manner, certain incidents
of my convalescent home, in a way which, i flatter myself, greatly
amused my hostess. john, of course, good fellow though he is, could
hardly be called a brilliant conversationalist.

at that moment a well remembered voice floated through the open french
window near at hand:

‚Äúthen you‚Äôll write to the princess after tea, alfred? i‚Äôll write to
lady tadminster for the second day, myself. or shall we wait until we
hear from the princess? in case of a refusal, lady tadminster might
open it the first day, and mrs. crosbie the second. then there‚Äôs the
duchess‚Äîabout the school f√™te.‚Äù

there was the murmur of a man‚Äôs voice, and then mrs. inglethorp‚Äôs rose
in reply:

‚Äúyes, certainly. after tea will do quite well. you are so thoughtful,
alfred dear.‚Äù

the french window swung open a little wider, and a handsome
white-haired old lady, with a somewhat masterful cast of features,
stepped out of it on to the lawn. a man followed her, a suggestion of
deference in his manner.

mrs. inglethorp greeted me with effusion.

‚Äúwhy, if it isn‚Äôt too delightful to see you again, mr. hastings, after
all these years. alfred, darling, mr. hastings‚Äîmy husband.‚Äù

i looked with some curiosity at ‚Äúalfred darling‚Äù. he certainly struck a
rather alien note. i did not wonder at john objecting to his beard. it
was one of the longest and blackest i have ever seen. he wore
gold-rimmed pince-nez, and had a curious impassivity of feature. it
struck me that he might look natural on a stage, but was strangely out
of place in real life. his voice was rather deep and unctuous. he
placed a wooden hand in mine and said:

‚Äúthis is a pleasure, mr. hastings.‚Äù then, turning to his wife: ‚Äúemily
dearest, i think that cushion is a little damp.‚Äù

she beamed fondly on him, as he substituted another with every
demonstration of the tenderest care. strange infatuation of an
otherwise sensible woman!

with the presence of mr. inglethorp, a sense of constraint and veiled
hostility seemed to settle down upon the company. miss howard, in
particular, took no pains to conceal her feelings. mrs. inglethorp,
however, seemed to notice nothing unusual. her volubility, which i
remembered of old, had lost nothing in the intervening years, and she
poured out a steady flood of conversation, mainly on the subject of the
forthcoming bazaar which she was organizing and which was to take place
shortly. occasionally she referred to her husband over a question of
days or dates. his watchful and attentive manner never varied. from the
very first i took a firm and rooted dislike to him, and i flatter
myself that my first judgments are usually fairly shrewd.

[7m--More--(3%)[27mpresently mrs. inglethorp turned to give some instructions about
letters to evelyn howard, and her husband addressed me in his
painstaking voice:

‚Äúis soldiering your regular profession, mr. hastings?‚Äù

‚Äúno, before the war i was in lloyd‚Äôs.‚Äù

‚Äúand you will return there after it is over?‚Äù

‚Äúperhaps. either that or a fresh start altogether.‚Äù

mary cavendish leant forward.

‚Äúwhat would you really choose as a profession, if you could just
consult your inclination?‚Äù

‚Äúwell, that depends.‚Äù

‚Äúno secret hobby?‚Äù she asked. ‚Äútell me‚Äîyou‚Äôre drawn to something?
everyone is‚Äîusually something absurd.‚Äù

‚Äúyou‚Äôll laugh at me.‚Äù

she smiled.

‚Äúperhaps.‚Äù

‚Äúwell, i‚Äôve always had a secret hankering to be a detective!‚Äù

‚Äúthe real thing‚Äîscotland yard? or sherlock holmes?‚Äù

‚Äúoh, sherlock holmes by all means. but really, seriously, i am awfully
drawn to it. i came across a man in belgium once, a very famous
detective, and he quite inflamed me. he was a marvellous little fellow.
he used to say that all good detective work was a mere matter of
method. my system is based on his‚Äîthough of course i have progressed
rather further. he was a funny little man, a great dandy, but
wonderfully clever.‚Äù

‚Äúlike a good detective story myself,‚Äù remarked miss howard. ‚Äúlots of
nonsense written, though. criminal discovered in last chapter. everyone
dumbfounded. real crime‚Äîyou‚Äôd know at once.‚Äù

‚Äúthere have been a great number of undiscovered crimes,‚Äù i argued.

‚Äúdon‚Äôt mean the police, but the people that are right in it. the
family. you couldn‚Äôt really hoodwink them. they‚Äôd know.‚Äù

‚Äúthen,‚Äù i said, much amused, ‚Äúyou think that if you were mixed up in a
crime, say a murder, you‚Äôd be able to spot the murderer right off?‚Äù

‚Äúof course i should. mightn‚Äôt be able to prove it to a pack of lawyers.
but i‚Äôm certain i‚Äôd know. i‚Äôd feel it in my fingertips if he came near
me.‚Äù

‚Äúit might be a ‚Äòshe‚Äô,‚Äù i suggested.

‚Äúmight. but murder‚Äôs a violent crime. associate it more with a man.‚Äù

‚Äúnot in a case of poisoning.‚Äù mrs. cavendish‚Äôs clear voice startled me.

i will therefore briefly set down the circumstances which led to my
being connected with the affair.

i had been invalided home from the front; and, after spending some
months in a rather depressing convalescent home, was given a month‚Äôs
sick leave. having no near relations or friends, i was trying to make
up my mind what to do, when i ran across john cavendish. i had seen
very little of him for some years. indeed, i had never known him
particularly well. he was a good fifteen years my senior, for one
thing, though he hardly looked his forty-five years. as a boy, though,
i had often stayed at styles, his mother‚Äôs place in essex.

we had a good yarn about old times, and it ended in his inviting me
down to styles to spend my leave there.

‚Äúthe mater will be delighted to see you again‚Äîafter all those years,‚Äù
he added.

‚Äúyour mother keeps well?‚Äù i asked.

‚Äúoh, yes. i suppose you know that she has married again?‚Äù

i am afraid i showed my surprise rather plainly. mrs. cavendish, who
had married john‚Äôs father when he was a widower with two sons, had been
a handsome woman of middle-age as i remembered her. she certainly could
not be a day less than seventy now. i recalled her as an energetic,
autocratic personality, somewhat inclined to charitable and social
notoriety, with a fondness for opening bazaars and playing the lady
bountiful. she was a most generous woman, and possessed a considerable
fortune of her own.

their country-place, styles court, had been purchased by mr. cavendish
early in their married life. he had been completely under his wife‚Äôs
ascendancy, so much so that, on dying, he left the place to her for her
lifetime, as well as the larger part of his income; an arrangement that
was distinctly unfair to his two sons. their step-mother, however, had
always been most generous to them; indeed, they were so young at the
time of their father‚Äôs remarriage that they always thought of her as
their own mother.

lawrence, the younger, had been a delicate youth. he had qualified as a
doctor but early relinquished the profession of medicine, and lived at
home while pursuing literary ambitions; though his verses never had any
marked success.

john practised for some time as a barrister, but had finally settled
down to the more congenial life of a country squire. he had married two
years ago, and had taken his wife to live at styles, though i
entertained a shrewd suspicion that he would have preferred his mother
to increase his allowance, which would have enabled him to have a home
of his own. mrs. cavendish, however, was a lady who liked to make her
own plans, and expected other people to fall in with them, and in this
case she certainly had the whip hand, namely: the purse strings.

john noticed my surprise at the news of his mother‚Äôs remarriage and
smiled rather ruefully.

‚Äúrotten little bounder too!‚Äù he said savagely. ‚Äúi can tell you,
hastings, it‚Äôs making life jolly difficult for us. as for evie‚Äîyou
remember evie?‚Äù

‚Äúno.‚Äù

chapter i . i go to styles

the intense interest aroused in the public by what was known at the
time as ‚Äúthe styles case‚Äù has now somewhat subsided . nevertheless, in
view of the world-wide notoriety which attended it, i have been asked,
both by my friend poirot and the family themselves, to write an account
of the whole story . this, we trust, will effectually silence the
sensational rumours which still persist .

i will therefore briefly set down the circumstances which led to my
being connected with the affair .

i had been invalided home from the front; and, after spending some
months in a rather depressing convalescent home, was given a month‚Äôs
sick leave . having no near relations or friends, i was trying to make
up my mind what to do, when i ran across john cavendish . i had seen
very little of him for some years . indeed, i had never known him
particularly well . he was a good fifteen years my senior, for one
thing, though he hardly looked his forty-five years . as a boy, though,
i had often stayed at styles, his mother‚Äôs place in essex .

we had a good yarn about old times, and it ended in his inviting me
down to styles to spend my leave there .

‚Äúthe mater will be delighted to see you again‚Äîafter all those years,‚Äù
he added .

‚Äúyour mother keeps well ?‚Äù i asked .

‚Äúoh, yes . i suppose you know that she has married again ?‚Äù

i am afraid i showed my surprise rather plainly . mrs . cavendish, who
had married john‚Äôs father when he was a widower with two sons, had been
a handsome woman of middle-age as i remembered her . she certainly could
not be a day less than seventy now . i recalled her as an energetic,
autocratic personality, somewhat inclined to charitable and social
notoriety, with a fondness for opening bazaars and playing the lady
bountiful . she was a most generous woman, and possessed a considerable
fortune of her own .

their country-place, styles court, had been purchased by mr . cavendish
early in their married life . he had been completely under his wife‚Äôs
ascendancy, so much so that, on dying, he left the place to her for her
lifetime, as well as the larger part of his income; an arrangement that
was distinctly unfair to his two sons . their step-mother, however, had
always been most generous to them; indeed, they were so young at the
time of their father‚Äôs remarriage that they always thought of her as
their own mother .

lawrence, the younger, had been a delicate youth . he had qualified as a
doctor but early relinquished the profession of medicine, and lived at
home while pursuing literary ambitions; though his verses never had any
marked success .

john practised for some time as a barrister, but had finally settled
down to the more congenial life of a country squire . he had married two
years ago, and had taken his wife to live at styles, though i
entertained a shrewd suspicion that he would have preferred his mother
to increase his allowance, which would have enabled him to have a home
of his own . mrs . cavendish, however, was a lady who liked to make her
own plans, and expected other people to fall in with them, and in this
case she certainly had the whip hand, namely: the purse strings .

john noticed my surprise at the news of his mother‚Äôs remarriage and
smiled rather ruefully .

‚Äúrotten little bounder too !‚Äù he said savagely . ‚Äúi can tell you,
hastings, it‚Äôs making life jolly difficult for us . as for evie‚Äîyou
remember evie ?‚Äù

‚Äúno .‚Äù

‚Äúoh, i suppose she was after your time . she‚Äôs the mater‚Äôs factotum,
companion, jack of all trades ! a great sport‚Äîold evie ! not precisely
young and beautiful, but as game as they make them .‚Äù

‚Äúyou were going to say‚Äî‚Äî ?‚Äù

‚Äúoh, this fellow ! he turned up from nowhere, on the pretext of being a
second cousin or something of evie‚Äôs, though she didn‚Äôt seem
particularly keen to acknowledge the relationship . the fellow is an
absolute outsider, anyone can see that . he‚Äôs got a great black beard,
and wears patent leather boots in all weathers ! but the mater cottoned
to him at once, took him on as secretary‚Äîyou know how she‚Äôs always
running a hundred societies ?‚Äù

i nodded .

‚Äúwell, of course the war has turned the hundreds into thousands . no
doubt the fellow was very useful to her . but you could have knocked us
all down with a feather when, three months ago, she suddenly announced
that she and alfred were engaged ! the fellow must be at least twenty
years younger than she is ! it‚Äôs simply bare-faced fortune hunting; but
there you are‚Äîshe is her own mistress, and she‚Äôs married him .‚Äù

‚Äúit must be a difficult situation for you all .‚Äù

‚Äúdifficult ! it‚Äôs damnable !‚Äù

thus it came about that, three days later, i descended from the train
at styles st . mary, an absurd little station, with no apparent reason
for existence, perched up in the midst of green fields and country
lanes . john cavendish was waiting on the platform, and piloted me out
to the car .

‚Äúgot a drop or two of petrol still, you see,‚Äù he remarked . ‚Äúmainly
owing to the mater‚Äôs activities .‚Äù

the village of styles st . mary was situated about two miles from the
little station, and styles court lay a mile the other side of it . it
was a still, warm day in early july . as one looked out over the flat
essex country, lying so green and peaceful under the afternoon sun, it
seemed almost impossible to believe that, not so very far away, a great
war was running its appointed course . i felt i had suddenly strayed
into another world . as we turned in at the lodge gates, john said:

‚Äúi‚Äôm afraid you‚Äôll find it very quiet down here, hastings .‚Äù

‚Äúmy dear fellow, that‚Äôs just what i want .‚Äù

‚Äúoh, it‚Äôs pleasant enough if you want to lead the idle life . i drill
with the volunteers twice a week, and lend a hand at the farms . my wife
works regularly ‚Äòon the land‚Äô . she is up at five every morning to milk,
and keeps at it steadily until lunchtime . it‚Äôs a jolly good life taking
it all round‚Äîif it weren‚Äôt for that fellow alfred inglethorp !‚Äù he
checked the car suddenly, and glanced at his watch . ‚Äúi wonder if we‚Äôve
time to pick up cynthia . no, she‚Äôll have started from the hospital by
now .‚Äù

‚Äúcynthia ! that‚Äôs not your wife ?‚Äù

‚Äúno, cynthia is a prot√©g√©e of my mother‚Äôs, the daughter of an old
schoolfellow of hers, who married a rascally solicitor . he came a
cropper, and the girl was left an orphan and penniless . my mother came
to the rescue, and cynthia has been with us nearly two years now . she
works in the red cross hospital at tadminster, seven miles away .‚Äù

as he spoke the last words, we drew up in front of the fine old house .
a lady in a stout tweed skirt, who was bending over a flower bed,
straightened herself at our approach .

‚Äúhullo, evie, here‚Äôs our wounded hero ! mr . hastings‚Äîmiss howard .‚Äù

miss howard shook hands with a hearty, almost painful, grip . i had an
impression of very blue eyes in a sunburnt face . she was a
pleasant-looking woman of about forty, with a deep voice, almost manly
in its stentorian tones, and had a large sensible square body, with
feet to match‚Äîthese last encased in good thick boots . her conversation,
i soon found, was couched in the telegraphic style .

‚Äúweeds grow like house afire . can‚Äôt keep even with ‚Äôem . shall press you
in . better be careful .‚Äù

‚Äúi‚Äôm sure i shall be only too delighted to make myself useful,‚Äù i
responded .

‚Äúdon‚Äôt say it . never does . wish you hadn‚Äôt later .‚Äù

‚Äúyou‚Äôre a cynic, evie,‚Äù said john, laughing . ‚Äúwhere‚Äôs tea to-day‚Äîinside
or out ?‚Äù

‚Äúout . too fine a day to be cooped up in the house .‚Äù

‚Äúcome on then, you‚Äôve done enough gardening for to-day . ‚Äòthe labourer
is worthy of his hire‚Äô, you know . come and be refreshed .‚Äù

‚Äúwell,‚Äù said miss howard, drawing off her gardening gloves, ‚Äúi‚Äôm
inclined to agree with you .‚Äù

she led the way round the house to where tea was spread under the shade
of a large sycamore .

a figure rose from one of the basket chairs, and came a few steps to
meet us .

‚Äúmy wife, hastings,‚Äù said john .

i shall never forget my first sight of mary cavendish . her tall,
slender form, outlined against the bright light; the vivid sense of
slumbering fire that seemed to find expression only in those wonderful
tawny eyes of hers, remarkable eyes, different from any other woman‚Äôs
that i have ever known; the intense power of stillness she possessed,
which nevertheless conveyed the impression of a wild untamed spirit in
an exquisitely civilised body‚Äîall these things are burnt into my
memory . i shall never forget them .

she greeted me with a few words of pleasant welcome in a low clear
voice, and i sank into a basket chair feeling distinctly glad that i
had accepted john‚Äôs invitation . mrs . cavendish gave me some tea, and
her few quiet remarks heightened my first impression of her as a
thoroughly fascinating woman . an appreciative listener is always
stimulating, and i described, in a humorous manner, certain incidents
of my convalescent home, in a way which, i flatter myself, greatly
amused my hostess . john, of course, good fellow though he is, could
hardly be called a brilliant conversationalist .

at that moment a well remembered voice floated through the open french
window near at hand:

‚Äúthen you‚Äôll write to the princess after tea, alfred ? i‚Äôll write to
lady tadminster for the second day, myself . or shall we wait until we
hear from the princess ? in case of a refusal, lady tadminster might
open it the first day, and mrs . crosbie the second . then there‚Äôs the
duchess‚Äîabout the school f√™te .‚Äù

there was the murmur of a man‚Äôs voice, and then mrs . inglethorp‚Äôs rose
in reply:

‚Äúyes, certainly . after tea will do quite well . you are so thoughtful,
alfred dear .‚Äù

the french window swung open a little wider, and a handsome
white-haired old lady, with a somewhat masterful cast of features,
stepped out of it on to the lawn . a man followed her, a suggestion of
deference in his manner .

mrs . inglethorp greeted me with effusion .

‚Äúwhy, if it isn‚Äôt too delightful to see you again, mr . hastings, after
all these years . alfred, darling, mr . hastings‚Äîmy husband .‚Äù

i looked with some curiosity at ‚Äúalfred darling‚Äù . he certainly struck a
rather alien note . i did not wonder at john objecting to his beard . it
was one of the longest and blackest i have ever seen . he wore
gold-rimmed pince-nez, and had a curious impassivity of feature . it
struck me that he might look natural on a stage, but was strangely out
of place in real life . his voice was rather deep and unctuous . he
placed a wooden hand in mine and said:

‚Äúthis is a pleasure, mr . hastings .‚Äù then, turning to his wife: ‚Äúemily
dearest, i think that cushion is a little damp .‚Äù

she beamed fondly on him, as he substituted another with every
demonstration of the tenderest care . strange infatuation of an
otherwise sensible woman !

with the presence of mr . inglethorp, a sense of constraint and veiled
hostility seemed to settle down upon the company . miss howard, in
particular, took no pains to conceal her feelings . mrs . inglethorp,
however, seemed to notice nothing unusual . her volubility, which i
remembered of old, had lost nothing in the intervening years, and she
poured out a steady flood of conversation, mainly on the subject of the
forthcoming bazaar which she was organizing and which was to take place
shortly . occasionally she referred to her husband over a question of
days or dates . his watchful and attentive manner never varied . from the
very first i took a firm and rooted dislike to him, and i flatter
myself that my first judgments are usually fairly shrewd .

presently mrs . inglethorp turned to give some instructions about
letters to evelyn howard, and her husband addressed me in his
painstaking voice:

‚Äúis soldiering your regular profession, mr . hastings ?‚Äù

‚Äúno, before the war i was in lloyd‚Äôs .‚Äù

‚Äúand you will return there after it is over ?‚Äù

‚Äúperhaps . either that or a fresh start altogether .‚Äù

mary cavendish leant forward .

‚Äúwhat would you really choose as a profession, if you could just
consult your inclination ?‚Äù

‚Äúwell, that depends .‚Äù

‚Äúno secret hobby ?‚Äù she asked . ‚Äútell me‚Äîyou‚Äôre drawn to something ?
everyone is‚Äîusually something absurd .‚Äù

‚Äúyou‚Äôll laugh at me .‚Äù

she smiled .

‚Äúperhaps .‚Äù

‚Äúwell, i‚Äôve always had a secret hankering to be a detective !‚Äù

‚Äúthe real thing‚Äîscotland yard ? or sherlock holmes ?‚Äù

‚Äúoh, sherlock holmes by all means . but really, seriously, i am awfully
drawn to it . i came across a man in belgium once, a very famous
detective, and he quite inflamed me . he was a marvellous little fellow .
he used to say that all good detective work was a mere matter of
method . my system is based on his‚Äîthough of course i have progressed
rather further . he was a funny little man, a great dandy, but
wonderfully clever .‚Äù

‚Äúlike a good detective story myself,‚Äù remarked miss howard . ‚Äúlots of
nonsense written, though . criminal discovered in last chapter . everyone
dumbfounded . real crime‚Äîyou‚Äôd know at once .‚Äù

‚Äúthere have been a great number of undiscovered crimes,‚Äù i argued .

‚Äúdon‚Äôt mean the police, but the people that are right in it . the
family . you couldn‚Äôt really hoodwink them . they‚Äôd know .‚Äù

‚Äúthen,‚Äù i said, much amused, ‚Äúyou think that if you were mixed up in a
crime, say a murder, you‚Äôd be able to spot the murderer right off ?‚Äù

‚Äúof course i should . mightn‚Äôt be able to prove it to a pack of lawyers .
but i‚Äôm certain i‚Äôd know . i‚Äôd feel it in my fingertips if he came near
me .‚Äù

‚Äúit might be a ‚Äòshe‚Äô,‚Äù i suggested .

‚Äúmight . but murder‚Äôs a violent crime . associate it more with a man .‚Äù

‚Äúnot in a case of poisoning .‚Äù mrs . cavendish‚Äôs clear voice startled me .
‚Äúdr . bauerstein was saying yesterday that, owing to the general
ignorance of the more uncommon poisons among the medical profession,
there were probably countless cases of poisoning quite unsuspected .‚Äù

‚Äúwhy, mary, what a gruesome conversation !‚Äù cried mrs . inglethorp . ‚Äúit
makes me feel as if a goose were walking over my grave . oh, there‚Äôs
cynthia !‚Äù

a young girl in v .a .d . uniform ran lightly across the lawn .

‚Äúwhy, cynthia, you are late to-day . this is mr . hastings‚Äîmiss murdoch .‚Äù

cynthia murdoch was a fresh-looking young creature, full of life and
vigour . she tossed off her little v .a .d . cap, and i admired the great
loose waves of her auburn hair, and the smallness and whiteness of the
hand she held out to claim her tea . with dark eyes and eyelashes she
would have been a beauty .

she flung herself down on the ground beside john, and as i handed her a
plate of sandwiches she smiled up at me .

‚Äúsit down here on the grass, do . it‚Äôs ever so much nicer .‚Äù

i dropped down obediently .

‚Äúyou work at tadminster, don‚Äôt you, miss murdoch ?‚Äù

she nodded .

‚Äúfor my sins .‚Äù

‚Äúdo they bully you, then ?‚Äù i asked, smiling .

‚Äúi should like to see them !‚Äù cried cynthia with dignity .

‚Äúi have got a cousin who is nursing,‚Äù i remarked . ‚Äúand she is terrified
of ‚Äòsisters‚Äô .‚Äù

‚Äúi don‚Äôt wonder . sisters _are_, you know, mr . hastings . they simp-ly
_are_ ! you‚Äôve no idea ! but i‚Äôm not a nurse, thank heaven, i work in the
dispensary .‚Äù

‚Äúhow many people do you poison ?‚Äù i asked, smiling .

cynthia smiled too .

‚Äúoh, hundreds !‚Äù she said .

‚Äúcynthia,‚Äù called mrs . inglethorp, ‚Äúdo you think you could write a few
notes for me ?‚Äù

‚Äúcertainly, aunt emily .‚Äù

she jumped up promptly, and something in her manner reminded me that
her position was a dependent one, and that mrs . inglethorp, kind as she
might be in the main, did not allow her to forget it .

my hostess turned to me .

‚Äújohn will show you your room . supper is at half-past seven . we have
given up late dinner for some time now . lady tadminster, our member‚Äôs
wife‚Äîshe was the late lord abbotsbury‚Äôs daughter‚Äîdoes the same . she
agrees with me that one must set an example of economy . we are quite a
war household; nothing is wasted here‚Äîevery scrap of waste paper, even,
is saved and sent away in sacks .‚Äù

i expressed my appreciation, and john took me into the house and up the
broad staircase, which forked right and left half-way to different
wings of the building . my room was in the left wing, and looked out
over the park .

john left me, and a few minutes later i saw him from my window walking
slowly across the grass arm in arm with cynthia murdoch . i heard mrs .
inglethorp call ‚Äúcynthia‚Äù impatiently, and the girl started and ran
back to the house . at the same moment, a man stepped out from the
shadow of a tree and walked slowly in the same direction . he looked
about forty, very dark with a melancholy clean-shaven face . some
violent emotion seemed to be mastering him . he looked up at my window
as he passed, and i recognized him, though he had changed much in the
fifteen years that had elapsed since we last met . it was john‚Äôs younger
brother, lawrence cavendish . i wondered what it was that had brought
that singular expression to his face .

then i dismissed him from my mind, and returned to the contemplation of
my own affairs .

the evening passed pleasantly enough; and i dreamed that night of that
enigmatical woman, mary cavendish .

the next morning dawned bright and sunny, and i was full of the
anticipation of a delightful visit .

i did not see mrs . cavendish until lunch-time, when she volunteered to
take me for a walk, and we spent a charming afternoon roaming in the
woods, returning to the house about five .

as we entered the large hall, john beckoned us both into the
smoking-room . i saw at once by his face that something disturbing had
occurred . we followed him in, and he shut the door after us .

‚Äúlook here, mary, there‚Äôs the deuce of a mess . evie‚Äôs had a row with
alfred inglethorp, and she‚Äôs off .‚Äù

‚Äúevie ? off ?‚Äù

john nodded gloomily .

‚Äúyes; you see she went to the mater, and‚Äîoh,‚Äîhere‚Äôs evie herself .‚Äù

miss howard entered . her lips were set grimly together, and she carried
a small suit-case . she looked excited and determined, and slightly on
the defensive .

‚Äúat any rate,‚Äù she burst out, ‚Äúi‚Äôve spoken my mind !‚Äù

‚Äúmy dear evelyn,‚Äù cried mrs . cavendish, ‚Äúthis can‚Äôt be true !‚Äù

miss howard nodded grimly .

‚Äútrue enough ! afraid i said some things to emily she won‚Äôt forget or
forgive in a hurry . don‚Äôt mind if they‚Äôve only sunk in a bit . probably
water off a duck‚Äôs back, though . i said right out: ‚Äòyou‚Äôre an old
woman, emily, and there‚Äôs no fool like an old fool . the man‚Äôs twenty
years younger than you, and don‚Äôt you fool yourself as to what he
married you for . money ! well, don‚Äôt let him have too much of it . farmer
raikes has got a very pretty young wife . just ask your alfred how much
time he spends over there .‚Äô she was very angry . natural ! i went on,
‚Äòi‚Äôm going to warn you, whether you like it or not . that man would as
soon murder you in your bed as look at you . he‚Äôs a bad lot . you can say
what you like to me, but remember what i‚Äôve told you . he‚Äôs a bad lot !‚Äô‚Äù

‚Äúwhat did she say ?‚Äù

miss howard made an extremely expressive grimace .

‚Äú‚Äòdarling alfred‚Äô‚Äî‚Äòdearest alfred‚Äô‚Äî‚Äòwicked calumnies‚Äô ‚Äî‚Äòwicked
lies‚Äô‚Äî‚Äòwicked woman‚Äô‚Äîto accuse her ‚Äòdear husband !‚Äô the sooner i left
her house the better . so i‚Äôm off .‚Äù

‚Äúbut not now ?‚Äù

‚Äúthis minute !‚Äù

for a moment we sat and stared at her . finally john cavendish, finding
his persuasions of no avail, went off to look up the trains . his wife
followed him, murmuring something about persuading mrs . inglethorp to
think better of it .

as she left the room, miss howard‚Äôs face changed . she leant towards me
eagerly .

‚Äúmr . hastings, you‚Äôre honest . i can trust you ?‚Äù

i was a little startled . she laid her hand on my arm, and sank her
voice to a whisper .

‚Äúlook after her, mr . hastings . my poor emily . they‚Äôre a lot of
sharks‚Äîall of them . oh, i know what i‚Äôm talking about . there isn‚Äôt one
of them that‚Äôs not hard up and trying to get money out of her . i‚Äôve
protected her as much as i could . now i‚Äôm out of the way, they‚Äôll
impose upon her .‚Äù

‚Äúof course, miss howard,‚Äù i said, ‚Äúi‚Äôll do everything i can, but i‚Äôm
sure you‚Äôre excited and overwrought .‚Äù

she interrupted me by slowly shaking her forefinger .

‚Äúyoung man, trust me . i‚Äôve lived in the world rather longer than you
have . all i ask you is to keep your eyes open . you‚Äôll see what i mean .‚Äù

the throb of the motor came through the open window, and miss howard
rose and moved to the door . john‚Äôs voice sounded outside . with her hand
on the handle, she turned her head over her shoulder, and beckoned to
me .

‚Äúabove all, mr . hastings, watch that devil‚Äîher husband !‚Äù

there was no time for more . miss howard was swallowed up in an eager
chorus of protests and good-byes . the inglethorps did not appear .

as the motor drove away, mrs . cavendish suddenly detached herself from
the group, and moved across the drive to the lawn to meet a tall
bearded man who had been evidently making for the house . the colour
rose in her cheeks as she held out her hand to him .

‚Äúwho is that ?‚Äù i asked sharply, for instinctively i distrusted the man .

‚Äúthat‚Äôs dr . bauerstein,‚Äù said john shortly .

‚Äúand who is dr . bauerstein ?‚Äù

‚Äúhe‚Äôs staying in the village doing a rest cure, after a bad nervous
breakdown . he‚Äôs a london specialist; a very clever man‚Äîone of the
greatest living experts on poisons, i believe .‚Äù

‚Äúand he‚Äôs a great friend of mary‚Äôs,‚Äù put in cynthia, the irrepressible .

john cavendish frowned and changed the subject .

‚Äúcome for a stroll, hastings . this has been a most rotten business . she
always had a rough tongue, but there is no stauncher friend in england
than evelyn howard .‚Äù

he took the path through the plantation, and we walked down to the
village through the woods which bordered one side of the estate .

as we passed through one of the gates on our way home again, a pretty
young woman of gipsy type coming in the opposite direction bowed and
smiled .

‚Äúthat‚Äôs a pretty girl,‚Äù i remarked appreciatively .

john‚Äôs face hardened .

‚Äúthat is mrs . raikes .‚Äù

‚Äúthe one that miss howard‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù

‚Äúexactly,‚Äù said john, with rather unnecessary abruptness .

i thought of the white-haired old lady in the big house, and that vivid
wicked little face that had just smiled into ours, and a vague chill of
foreboding crept over me . i brushed it aside .

‚Äústyles is really a glorious old place,‚Äù i said to john .

he nodded rather gloomily .

‚Äúyes, it‚Äôs a fine property . it‚Äôll be mine some day‚Äîshould be mine now
by rights, if my father had only made a decent will . and then i
shouldn‚Äôt be so damned hard up as i am now .‚Äù

‚Äúhard up, are you ?‚Äù

‚Äúmy dear hastings, i don‚Äôt mind telling you that i‚Äôm at my wits‚Äô end
for money .‚Äù

‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt your brother help you ?‚Äù

‚Äúlawrence ? he‚Äôs gone through every penny he ever had, publishing rotten
verses in fancy bindings . no, we‚Äôre an impecunious lot . my mother‚Äôs
always been awfully good to us, i must say . that is, up to now . since
her marriage, of course‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù he broke off, frowning .

for the first time i felt that, with evelyn howard, something
indefinable had gone from the atmosphere . her presence had spelt
security . now that security was removed‚Äîand the air seemed rife with
suspicion . the sinister face of dr . bauerstein recurred to me
unpleasantly . a vague suspicion of everyone and everything filled my
mind . just for a moment i had a premonition of approaching evil .






chapter ii . the 16th and 17th of july

i had arrived at styles on the 5th of july . i come now to the events of
the 16th and 17th of that month . for the convenience of the reader i
will recapitulate the incidents of those days in as exact a manner as
possible . they were elicited subsequently at the trial by a process of
long and tedious cross-examinations .

i received a letter from evelyn howard a couple of days after her
departure, telling me she was working as a nurse at the big hospital in
middlingham, a manufacturing town some fifteen miles away, and begging
me to let her know if mrs . inglethorp should show any wish to be
reconciled .

the only fly in the ointment of my peaceful days was mrs . cavendish‚Äôs
extraordinary, and, for my part, unaccountable preference for the
society of dr . bauerstein . what she saw in the man i cannot imagine,
but she was always asking him up to the house, and often went off for
long expeditions with him . i must confess that i was quite unable to
see his attraction .

the 16th of july fell on a monday . it was a day of turmoil . the famous
bazaar had taken place on saturday, and an entertainment, in connection
with the same charity, at which mrs . inglethorp was to recite a war
poem, was to be held that night . we were all busy during the morning
arranging and decorating the hall in the village where it was to take
place . we had a late luncheon and spent the afternoon resting in the
garden . i noticed that john‚Äôs manner was somewhat unusual . he seemed
very excited and restless .

after tea, mrs . inglethorp went to lie down to rest before her efforts
in the evening and i challenged mary cavendish to a single at tennis .

about a quarter to seven, mrs . inglethorp called us that we should be
late as supper was early that night . we had rather a scramble to get
ready in time; and before the meal was over the motor was waiting at
the door .

the entertainment was a great success, mrs . inglethorp‚Äôs recitation
receiving tremendous applause . there were also some tableaux in which
cynthia took part . she did not return with us, having been asked to a
supper party, and to remain the night with some friends who had been
acting with her in the tableaux .

the following morning, mrs . inglethorp stayed in bed to breakfast, as
she was rather overtired; but she appeared in her briskest mood about
12 .30, and swept lawrence and myself off to a luncheon party .

‚Äúsuch a charming invitation from mrs . rolleston . lady tadminster‚Äôs
sister, you know . the rollestons came over with the conqueror‚Äîone of
our oldest families .‚Äù

mary had excused herself on the plea of an engagement with dr .
bauerstein .

we had a pleasant luncheon, and as we drove away lawrence suggested
that we should return by tadminster, which was barely a mile out of our
way, and pay a visit to cynthia in her dispensary . mrs . inglethorp
replied that this was an excellent idea, but as she had several letters
to write she would drop us there, and we could come back with cynthia
in the pony-trap .

we were detained under suspicion by the hospital porter, until cynthia
appeared to vouch for us, looking very cool and sweet in her long white
overall . she took us up to her sanctum, and introduced us to her fellow
dispenser, a rather awe-inspiring individual, whom cynthia cheerily
addressed as ‚Äúnibs .‚Äù

‚Äúwhat a lot of bottles !‚Äù i exclaimed, as my eye travelled round the
small room . ‚Äúdo you really know what‚Äôs in them all ?‚Äù

‚Äúsay something original,‚Äù groaned cynthia . ‚Äúevery single person who
comes up here says that . we are really thinking of bestowing a prize on
the first individual who does _not_ say: ‚Äòwhat a lot of bottles !‚Äô and i
know the next thing you‚Äôre going to say is: ‚Äòhow many people have you
poisoned ?‚Äô‚Äù

i pleaded guilty with a laugh .

‚Äúif you people only knew how fatally easy it is to poison someone by
mistake, you wouldn‚Äôt joke about it . come on, let‚Äôs have tea . we‚Äôve got
all sorts of secret stories in that cupboard . no, lawrence‚Äîthat‚Äôs the
poison cupboard . the big cupboard‚Äîthat‚Äôs right .‚Äù

we had a very cheery tea, and assisted cynthia to wash up afterwards .
we had just put away the last tea-spoon when a knock came at the door .
the countenances of cynthia and nibs were suddenly petrified into a
stern and forbidding expression .

‚Äúcome in,‚Äù said cynthia, in a sharp professional tone .

a young and rather scared looking nurse appeared with a bottle which
she proffered to nibs, who waved her towards cynthia with the somewhat
enigmatical remark:

‚Äú_i_‚Äôm not really here to-day .‚Äù

cynthia took the bottle and examined it with the severity of a judge .

‚Äúthis should have been sent up this morning .‚Äù

‚Äúsister is very sorry . she forgot .‚Äù

‚Äúsister should read the rules outside the door .‚Äù

i gathered from the little nurse‚Äôs expression that there was not the
least likelihood of her having the hardihood to retail this message to
the dreaded ‚Äúsister‚Äù .

‚Äúso now it can‚Äôt be done until to-morrow,‚Äù finished cynthia .

‚Äúdon‚Äôt you think you could possibly let us have it to-night ?‚Äù

‚Äúwell,‚Äù said cynthia graciously, ‚Äúwe are very busy, but if we have time
it shall be done .‚Äù

the little nurse withdrew, and cynthia promptly took a jar from the
shelf, refilled the bottle, and placed it on the table outside the
door .

i laughed .

‚Äúdiscipline must be maintained ?‚Äù

‚Äúexactly . come out on our little balcony . you can see all the outside
wards there .‚Äù

i followed cynthia and her friend and they pointed out the different
wards to me . lawrence remained behind, but after a few moments cynthia
called to him over her shoulder to come and join us . then she looked at
her watch .

‚Äúnothing more to do, nibs ?‚Äù

‚Äúno .‚Äù

‚Äúall right . then we can lock up and go .‚Äù

i had seen lawrence in quite a different light that afternoon . compared
to john, he was an astoundingly difficult person to get to know . he was
the opposite of his brother in almost every respect, being unusually
shy and reserved . yet he had a certain charm of manner, and i fancied
that, if one really knew him well, one could have a deep affection for
him . i had always fancied that his manner to cynthia was rather
constrained, and that she on her side was inclined to be shy of him .
but they were both gay enough this afternoon, and chatted together like
a couple of children .

as we drove through the village, i remembered that i wanted some
stamps, so accordingly we pulled up at the post office .

as i came out again, i cannoned into a little man who was just
entering . i drew aside and apologised, when suddenly, with a loud
exclamation, he clasped me in his arms and kissed me warmly .

‚Äú_mon ami_ hastings !‚Äù he cried . ‚Äúit is indeed _mon ami_ hastings !‚Äù

‚Äúpoirot !‚Äù i exclaimed .

i turned to the pony-trap .

‚Äúthis is a very pleasant meeting for me, miss cynthia . this is my old
friend, monsieur poirot, whom i have not seen for years .‚Äù

‚Äúoh, we know monsieur poirot,‚Äù said cynthia gaily . ‚Äúbut i had no idea
he was a friend of yours .‚Äù

‚Äúyes, indeed,‚Äù said poirot seriously . ‚Äúi know mademoiselle cynthia . it
is by the charity of that good mrs . inglethorp that i am here .‚Äù then,
as i looked at him inquiringly: ‚Äúyes, my friend, she had kindly
extended hospitality to seven of my countrypeople who, alas, are
refugees from their native land . we belgians will always remember her
with gratitude .‚Äù

poirot was an extraordinary looking little man . he was hardly more than
five feet, four inches, but carried himself with great dignity . his
head was exactly the shape of an egg, and he always perched it a little
on one side . his moustache was very stiff and military . the neatness of
his attire was almost incredible . i believe a speck of dust would have
caused him more pain than a bullet wound . yet this quaint dandified
little man who, i was sorry to see, now limped badly, had been in his
time one of the most celebrated members of the belgian police . as a
detective, his _flair_ had been extraordinary, and he had achieved
triumphs by unravelling some of the most baffling cases of the day .

he pointed out to me the little house inhabited by him and his fellow
belgians, and i promised to go and see him at an early date . then he
raised his hat with a flourish to cynthia, and we drove away .

‚Äúhe‚Äôs a dear little man,‚Äù said cynthia . ‚Äúi‚Äôd no idea you knew him .‚Äù

‚Äúyou‚Äôve been entertaining a celebrity unawares,‚Äù i replied .

and, for the rest of the way home, i recited to them the various
exploits and triumphs of hercule poirot .

we arrived back in a very cheerful mood . as we entered the hall, mrs .
inglethorp came out of her boudoir . she looked flushed and upset .

‚Äúoh, it‚Äôs you,‚Äù she said .

‚Äúis there anything the matter, aunt emily ?‚Äù asked cynthia .

‚Äúcertainly not,‚Äù said mrs . inglethorp sharply . ‚Äúwhat should there be ?‚Äù
then catching sight of dorcas, the parlourmaid, going into the
dining-room, she called to her to bring some stamps into the boudoir .

‚Äúyes, m‚Äôm .‚Äù the old servant hesitated, then added diffidently: ‚Äúdon‚Äôt
you think, m‚Äôm, you‚Äôd better get to bed ? you‚Äôre looking very tired .‚Äù

‚Äúperhaps you‚Äôre right, dorcas‚Äîyes‚Äîno‚Äînot now . i‚Äôve some letters i must
finish by post-time . have you lighted the fire in my room as i told
you ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes, m‚Äôm .‚Äù

‚Äúthen i‚Äôll go to bed directly after supper .‚Äù

she went into the boudoir again, and cynthia stared after her .

‚Äúgoodness gracious ! i wonder what‚Äôs up ?‚Äù she said to lawrence .

he did not seem to have heard her, for without a word he turned on his
heel and went out of the house .

i suggested a quick game of tennis before supper and, cynthia agreeing,
i ran upstairs to fetch my racquet .

mrs . cavendish was coming down the stairs . it may have been my fancy,
but she, too, was looking odd and disturbed .

‚Äúhad a good walk with dr . bauerstein ?‚Äù i asked, trying to appear as
indifferent as i could .

‚Äúi didn‚Äôt go,‚Äù she replied abruptly . ‚Äúwhere is mrs . inglethorp ?‚Äù

‚Äúin the boudoir .‚Äù

her hand clenched itself on the banisters, then she seemed to nerve
herself for some encounter, and went rapidly past me down the stairs
across the hall to the boudoir, the door of which she shut behind her .

as i ran out to the tennis court a few moments later, i had to pass the
open boudoir window, and was unable to help overhearing the following
scrap of dialogue . mary cavendish was saying in the voice of a woman
desperately controlling herself:

‚Äúthen you won‚Äôt show it to me ?‚Äù

to which mrs . inglethorp replied:

‚Äúmy dear mary, it has nothing to do with that matter .‚Äù

‚Äúthen show it to me .‚Äù

‚Äúi tell you it is not what you imagine . it does not concern you in the
least .‚Äù

to which mary cavendish replied, with a rising bitterness:

‚Äúof course, i might have known you would shield him .‚Äù

cynthia was waiting for me, and greeted me eagerly with:

‚Äúi say ! there‚Äôs been the most awful row ! i‚Äôve got it all out of
dorcas .‚Äù

‚Äúwhat kind of a row ?‚Äù

‚Äúbetween aunt emily and _him_ . i do hope she‚Äôs found him out at last !‚Äù

‚Äúwas dorcas there, then ?‚Äù

‚Äúof course not . she ‚Äòhappened to be near the door‚Äô . it was a real old
bust-up . i do wish i knew what it was all about .‚Äù

i thought of mrs . raikes‚Äôs gipsy face, and evelyn howard‚Äôs warnings,
but wisely decided to hold my peace, whilst cynthia exhausted every
possible hypothesis, and cheerfully hoped, ‚Äúaunt emily will send him
away, and will never speak to him again .‚Äù

i was anxious to get hold of john, but he was nowhere to be seen .
evidently something very momentous had occurred that afternoon . i tried
to forget the few words i had overheard; but, do what i would, i could
not dismiss them altogether from my mind . what was mary cavendish‚Äôs
concern in the matter ?

mr . inglethorp was in the drawing-room when i came down to supper . his
face was impassive as ever, and the strange unreality of the man struck
me afresh .

mrs . inglethorp came down last . she still looked agitated, and during
the meal there was a somewhat constrained silence . inglethorp was
unusually quiet . as a rule, he surrounded his wife with little
attentions, placing a cushion at her back, and altogether playing the
part of the devoted husband . immediately after supper, mrs . inglethorp
retired to her boudoir again .

‚Äúsend my coffee in here, mary,‚Äù she called . ‚Äúi‚Äôve just five minutes to
catch the post .‚Äù

cynthia and i went and sat by the open window in the drawing-room . mary
cavendish brought our coffee to us . she seemed excited .

‚Äúdo you young people want lights, or do you enjoy the twilight ?‚Äù she
asked . ‚Äúwill you take mrs . inglethorp her coffee, cynthia ? i will pour
it out .‚Äù

‚Äúdo not trouble, mary,‚Äù said inglethorp . ‚Äúi will take it to emily .‚Äù he
poured it out, and went out of the room carrying it carefully .

lawrence followed him, and mrs . cavendish sat down by us .

we three sat for some time in silence . it was a glorious night, hot and
still . mrs . cavendish fanned herself gently with a palm leaf .

‚Äúit‚Äôs almost too hot,‚Äù she murmured . ‚Äúwe shall have a thunderstorm .‚Äù

alas, that these harmonious moments can never endure ! my paradise was
rudely shattered by the sound of a well known, and heartily disliked,
voice in the hall .

‚Äúdr . bauerstein !‚Äù exclaimed cynthia . ‚Äúwhat a funny time to come .‚Äù

i glanced jealously at mary cavendish, but she seemed quite
undisturbed, the delicate pallor of her cheeks did not vary .

in a few moments, alfred inglethorp had ushered the doctor in, the
latter laughing, and protesting that he was in no fit state for a
drawing-room . in truth, he presented a sorry spectacle, being literally
plastered with mud .

‚Äúwhat have you been doing, doctor ?‚Äù cried mrs . cavendish .

‚Äúi must make my apologies,‚Äù said the doctor . ‚Äúi did not really mean to
come in, but mr . inglethorp insisted .‚Äù

‚Äúwell, bauerstein, you are in a plight,‚Äù said john, strolling in from
the hall . ‚Äúhave some coffee, and tell us what you have been up to .‚Äù

‚Äúthank you, i will .‚Äù he laughed rather ruefully, as he described how he
had discovered a very rare species of fern in an inaccessible place,
and in his efforts to obtain it had lost his footing, and slipped
ignominiously into a neighbouring pond .

‚Äúthe sun soon dried me off,‚Äù he added, ‚Äúbut i‚Äôm afraid my appearance is
very disreputable .‚Äù

at this juncture, mrs . inglethorp called to cynthia from the hall, and
the girl ran out .

‚Äújust carry up my despatch-case, will you, dear ? i‚Äôm going to bed .‚Äù

the door into the hall was a wide one . i had risen when cynthia did,
john was close by me . there were therefore three witnesses who could
swear that mrs . inglethorp was carrying her coffee, as yet untasted, in
her hand .

my evening was utterly and entirely spoilt by the presence of dr .
bauerstein . it seemed to me the man would never go . he rose at last,
however, and i breathed a sigh of relief .

‚Äúi‚Äôll walk down to the village with you,‚Äù said mr . inglethorp . ‚Äúi must
see our agent over those estate accounts .‚Äù he turned to john . ‚Äúno one
need sit up . i will take the latch-key .‚Äù






chapter iii . the night of the tragedy

to make this part of my story clear, i append the following plan of the
first floor of styles . the servants‚Äô rooms are reached through the door
b . they have no communication with the right wing, where the
inglethorps‚Äô rooms were situated .




       01



it seemed to be the middle of the night when i was awakened by lawrence
cavendish . he had a candle in his hand, and the agitation of his face
told me at once that something was seriously wrong .

‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the matter ?‚Äù i asked, sitting up in bed, and trying to collect
my scattered thoughts .

‚Äúwe are afraid my mother is very ill . she seems to be having some kind
of fit . unfortunately she has locked herself in .‚Äù

‚Äúi‚Äôll come at once .‚Äù

i sprang out of bed; and, pulling on a dressing-gown, followed lawrence
along the passage and the gallery to the right wing of the house .

john cavendish joined us, and one or two of the servants were standing
round in a state of awe-stricken excitement . lawrence turned to his
brother .

‚Äúwhat do you think we had better do ?‚Äù

never, i thought, had his indecision of character been more apparent .

john rattled the handle of mrs . inglethorp‚Äôs door violently, but with
no effect . it was obviously locked or bolted on the inside . the whole
household was aroused by now . the most alarming sounds were audible
from the interior of the room . clearly something must be done .

‚Äútry going through mr . inglethorp‚Äôs room, sir,‚Äù cried dorcas . ‚Äúoh, the
poor mistress !‚Äù

suddenly i realized that alfred inglethorp was not with us‚Äîthat he
alone had given no sign of his presence . john opened the door of his
room . it was pitch dark, but lawrence was following with the candle,
and by its feeble light we saw that the bed had not been slept in, and
that there was no sign of the room having been occupied .

we went straight to the connecting door . that, too, was locked or
bolted on the inside . what was to be done ?

‚Äúoh, dear, sir,‚Äù cried dorcas, wringing her hands, ‚Äúwhat ever shall we
do ?‚Äù

‚Äúwe must try and break the door in, i suppose . it‚Äôll be a tough job,
though . here, let one of the maids go down and wake baily and tell him
to go for dr . wilkins at once . now then, we‚Äôll have a try at the door .
half a moment, though, isn‚Äôt there a door into miss cynthia‚Äôs rooms ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes, sir, but that‚Äôs always bolted . it‚Äôs never been undone .‚Äù

‚Äúwell, we might just see .‚Äù

he ran rapidly down the corridor to cynthia‚Äôs room . mary cavendish was
there, shaking the girl‚Äîwho must have been an unusually sound
sleeper‚Äîand trying to wake her .

in a moment or two he was back .

‚Äúno good . that‚Äôs bolted too . we must break in the door . i think this
one is a shade less solid than the one in the passage .‚Äù

we strained and heaved together . the framework of the door was solid,
and for a long time it resisted our efforts, but at last we felt it
give beneath our weight, and finally, with a resounding crash, it was
burst open .

we stumbled in together, lawrence still holding his candle . mrs .
inglethorp was lying on the bed, her whole form agitated by violent
convulsions, in one of which she must have overturned the table beside
her . as we entered, however, her limbs relaxed, and she fell back upon
the pillows .

john strode across the room, and lit the gas . turning to annie, one of
the housemaids, he sent her downstairs to the dining-room for brandy .
then he went across to his mother whilst i unbolted the door that gave
on the corridor .

i turned to lawrence, to suggest that i had better leave them now that
there was no further need of my services, but the words were frozen on
my lips . never have i seen such a ghastly look on any man‚Äôs face . he
was white as chalk, the candle he held in his shaking hand was
sputtering onto the carpet, and his eyes, petrified with terror, or
some such kindred emotion, stared fixedly over my head at a point on
the further wall . it was as though he had seen something that turned
him to stone . i instinctively followed the direction of his eyes, but i
could see nothing unusual . the still feebly flickering ashes in the
grate, and the row of prim ornaments on the mantelpiece, were surely
harmless enough .

the violence of mrs . inglethorp‚Äôs attack seemed to be passing . she was
able to speak in short gasps .

‚Äúbetter now‚Äîvery sudden‚Äîstupid of me‚Äîto lock myself in .‚Äù

a shadow fell on the bed and, looking up, i saw mary cavendish standing
near the door with her arm around cynthia . she seemed to be supporting
the girl, who looked utterly dazed and unlike herself . her face was
heavily flushed, and she yawned repeatedly .

‚Äúpoor cynthia is quite frightened,‚Äù said mrs . cavendish in a low clear
voice . she herself, i noticed, was dressed in her white land smock .
then it must be later than i thought . i saw that a faint streak of
daylight was showing through the curtains of the windows, and that the
clock on the mantelpiece pointed to close upon five o‚Äôclock .

a strangled cry from the bed startled me . a fresh access of pain seized
the unfortunate old lady . the convulsions were of a violence terrible
to behold . everything was confusion . we thronged round her, powerless
to help or alleviate . a final convulsion lifted her from the bed, until
she appeared to rest upon her head and her heels, with her body arched
in an extraordinary manner . in vain mary and john tried to administer
more brandy . the moments flew . again the body arched itself in that
peculiar fashion .

at that moment, dr . bauerstein pushed his way authoritatively into the
room . for one instant he stopped dead, staring at the figure on the
bed, and, at the same instant, mrs . inglethorp cried out in a strangled
voice, her eyes fixed on the doctor:

‚Äúalfred‚Äîalfred‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù then she fell back motionless on the pillows .

with a stride, the doctor reached the bed, and seizing her arms worked
them energetically, applying what i knew to be artificial respiration .
he issued a few short sharp orders to the servants . an imperious wave
of his hand drove us all to the door . we watched him, fascinated,
though i think we all knew in our hearts that it was too late, and that
nothing could be done now . i could see by the expression on his face
that he himself had little hope .

finally he abandoned his task, shaking his head gravely . at that
moment, we heard footsteps outside, and dr . wilkins, mrs . inglethorp‚Äôs
own doctor, a portly, fussy little man, came bustling in .

in a few words dr . bauerstein explained how he had happened to be
passing the lodge gates as the car came out, and had run up to the
house as fast as he could, whilst the car went on to fetch dr . wilkins .
with a faint gesture of the hand, he indicated the figure on the bed .

‚Äúve‚Äîry sad . ve‚Äîry sad,‚Äù murmured dr . wilkins . ‚Äúpoor dear lady . always
did far too much‚Äîfar too much‚Äîagainst my advice . i warned her . her
heart was far from strong . ‚Äòtake it easy,‚Äô i said to her,
‚Äòtake‚Äîit‚Äîeasy‚Äô . but no‚Äîher zeal for good works was too great . nature
rebelled . na‚Äîture‚Äîre‚Äîbelled .‚Äù

dr . bauerstein, i noticed, was watching the local doctor narrowly . he
still kept his eyes fixed on him as he spoke .

‚Äúthe convulsions were of a peculiar violence, dr . wilkins . i am sorry
you were not here in time to witness them . they were quite‚Äîtetanic in
character .‚Äù

‚Äúah !‚Äù said dr . wilkins wisely .

‚Äúi should like to speak to you in private,‚Äù said dr . bauerstein . he
turned to john . ‚Äúyou do not object ?‚Äù

‚Äúcertainly not .‚Äù

we all trooped out into the corridor, leaving the two doctors alone,
and i heard the key turned in the lock behind us .

we went slowly down the stairs . i was violently excited . i have a
certain talent for deduction, and dr . bauerstein‚Äôs manner had started a
flock of wild surmises in my mind . mary cavendish laid her hand upon my
arm .

‚Äúwhat is it ? why did dr . bauerstein seem so‚Äîpeculiar ?‚Äù

i looked at her .

‚Äúdo you know what i think ?‚Äù

‚Äúwhat ?‚Äù

‚Äúlisten !‚Äù i looked round, the others were out of earshot . i lowered my
voice to a whisper . ‚Äúi believe she has been poisoned ! i‚Äôm certain dr .
bauerstein suspects it .‚Äù

‚Äú_what ?_‚Äù she shrank against the wall, the pupils of her eyes dilating
wildly . then, with a sudden cry that startled me, she cried out: ‚Äúno,
no‚Äînot that‚Äînot that !‚Äù and breaking from me, fled up the stairs . i
followed her, afraid that she was going to faint . i found her leaning
against the bannisters, deadly pale . she waved me away impatiently .

‚Äúno, no‚Äîleave me . i‚Äôd rather be alone . let me just be quiet for a
minute or two . go down to the others .‚Äù

i obeyed her reluctantly . john and lawrence were in the dining-room . i
joined them . we were all silent, but i suppose i voiced the thoughts of
us all when i at last broke it by saying:

‚Äúwhere is mr . inglethorp ?‚Äù

john shook his head .

‚Äúhe‚Äôs not in the house .‚Äù

our eyes met . where _was_ alfred inglethorp ? his absence was strange
and inexplicable . i remembered mrs . inglethorp‚Äôs dying words . what lay
beneath them ? what more could she have told us, if she had had time ?

at last we heard the doctors descending the stairs . dr . wilkins was
looking important and excited, and trying to conceal an inward
exultation under a manner of decorous calm . dr . bauerstein remained in
the background, his grave bearded face unchanged . dr . wilkins was the
spokesman for the two . he addressed himself to john:

‚Äúmr . cavendish, i should like your consent to a post-mortem .‚Äù

‚Äúis that necessary ?‚Äù asked john gravely . a spasm of pain crossed his
face .

‚Äúabsolutely,‚Äù said dr . bauerstein .

‚Äúyou mean by that‚Äî‚Äî ?‚Äù

‚Äúthat neither dr . wilkins nor myself could give a death certificate
under the circumstances .‚Äù

john bent his head .

‚Äúin that case, i have no alternative but to agree .‚Äù

‚Äúthank you,‚Äù said dr . wilkins briskly . ‚Äúwe propose that it should take
place to-morrow night‚Äîor rather to-night .‚Äù and he glanced at the
daylight . ‚Äúunder the circumstances, i am afraid an inquest can hardly
be avoided‚Äîthese formalities are necessary, but i beg that you won‚Äôt
distress yourselves .‚Äù

there was a pause, and then dr . bauerstein drew two keys from his
pocket, and handed them to john .

‚Äúthese are the keys of the two rooms . i have locked them and, in my
opinion, they would be better kept locked for the present .‚Äù

the doctors then departed .

i had been turning over an idea in my head, and i felt that the moment
had now come to broach it . yet i was a little chary of doing so . john,
i knew, had a horror of any kind of publicity, and was an easygoing
optimist, who preferred never to meet trouble half-way . it might be
difficult to convince him of the soundness of my plan . lawrence, on the
other hand, being less conventional, and having more imagination, i
felt i might count upon as an ally . there was no doubt that the moment
had come for me to take the lead .

‚Äújohn,‚Äù i said, ‚Äúi am going to ask you something .‚Äù

‚Äúwell ?‚Äù

‚Äúyou remember my speaking of my friend poirot ? the belgian who is here ?
he has been a most famous detective .‚Äù

‚Äúyes .‚Äù

‚Äúi want you to let me call him in‚Äîto investigate this matter .‚Äù

‚Äúwhat‚Äînow ? before the post-mortem ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes, time is an advantage if‚Äîif‚Äîthere has been foul play .‚Äù

‚Äúrubbish !‚Äù cried lawrence angrily . ‚Äúin my opinion the whole thing is a
mare‚Äôs nest of bauerstein‚Äôs ! wilkins hadn‚Äôt an idea of such a thing,
until bauerstein put it into his head . but, like all specialists,
bauerstein‚Äôs got a bee in his bonnet . poisons are his hobby, so of
course he sees them everywhere .‚Äù

i confess that i was surprised by lawrence‚Äôs attitude . he was so seldom
vehement about anything .

john hesitated .

‚Äúi can‚Äôt feel as you do, lawrence,‚Äù he said at last . ‚Äúi‚Äôm inclined to
give hastings a free hand, though i should prefer to wait a bit . we
don‚Äôt want any unnecessary scandal .‚Äù

‚Äúno, no,‚Äù i cried eagerly, ‚Äúyou need have no fear of that . poirot is
discretion itself .‚Äù

‚Äúvery well, then, have it your own way . i leave it in your hands .
though, if it is as we suspect, it seems a clear enough case . god
forgive me if i am wronging him !‚Äù

i looked at my watch . it was six o‚Äôclock . i determined to lose no time .

five minutes‚Äô delay, however, i allowed myself . i spent it in
ransacking the library until i discovered a medical book which gave a
description of strychnine poisoning .






chapter iv . poirot investigates

the house which the belgians occupied in the village was quite close to
the park gates . one could save time by taking a narrow path through the
long grass, which cut off the detours of the winding drive . so i,
accordingly, went that way . i had nearly reached the lodge, when my
attention was arrested by the running figure of a man approaching me .
it was mr . inglethorp . where had he been ? how did he intend to explain
his absence ?

he accosted me eagerly .

‚Äúmy god ! this is terrible ! my poor wife ! i have only just heard .‚Äù

‚Äúwhere have you been ?‚Äù i asked .

‚Äúdenby kept me late last night . it was one o‚Äôclock before we‚Äôd
finished . then i found that i‚Äôd forgotten the latch-key after all . i
didn‚Äôt want to arouse the household, so denby gave me a bed .‚Äù

‚Äúhow did you hear the news ?‚Äù i asked .

‚Äúwilkins knocked denby up to tell him . my poor emily ! she was so
self-sacrificing‚Äîsuch a noble character . she over-taxed her strength .‚Äù

a wave of revulsion swept over me . what a consummate hypocrite the man
was !

‚Äúi must hurry on,‚Äù i said, thankful that he did not ask me whither i
was bound .

in a few minutes i was knocking at the door of leastways cottage .

getting no answer, i repeated my summons impatiently . a window above me
was cautiously opened, and poirot himself looked out .

he gave an exclamation of surprise at seeing me . in a few brief words,
i explained the tragedy that had occurred, and that i wanted his help .

‚Äúwait, my friend, i will let you in, and you shall recount to me the
affair whilst i dress .‚Äù

in a few moments he had unbarred the door, and i followed him up to his
room . there he installed me in a chair, and i related the whole story,
keeping back nothing, and omitting no circumstance, however
insignificant, whilst he himself made a careful and deliberate toilet .

i told him of my awakening, of mrs . inglethorp‚Äôs dying words, of her
husband‚Äôs absence, of the quarrel the day before, of the scrap of
conversation between mary and her mother-in-law that i had overheard,
of the former quarrel between mrs . inglethorp and evelyn howard, and of
the latter‚Äôs innuendoes .

i was hardly as clear as i could wish . i repeated myself several times,
and occasionally had to go back to some detail that i had forgotten .
poirot smiled kindly on me .

‚Äúthe mind is confused ? is it not so ? take time, _mon ami_ . you are
agitated; you are excited‚Äîit is but natural . presently, when we are
calmer, we will arrange the facts, neatly, each in his proper place . we
will examine‚Äîand reject . those of importance we will put on one side;
those of no importance, pouf !‚Äù‚Äîhe screwed up his cherub-like face, and
puffed comically enough‚Äî‚Äúblow them away !‚Äù

‚Äúthat‚Äôs all very well,‚Äù i objected, ‚Äúbut how are you going to decide
what is important, and what isn‚Äôt ? that always seems the difficulty to
me .‚Äù

poirot shook his head energetically . he was now arranging his moustache
with exquisite care .

‚Äúnot so . _voyons !_ one fact leads to another‚Äîso we continue . does the
next fit in with that ? _a merveille !_ good ! we can proceed . this next
little fact‚Äîno ! ah, that is curious ! there is something missing‚Äîa link
in the chain that is not there . we examine . we search . and that little
curious fact, that possibly paltry little detail that will not tally,
we put it here !‚Äù he made an extravagant gesture with his hand . ‚Äúit is
significant ! it is tremendous !‚Äù

‚Äúy‚Äîes‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù

‚Äúah !‚Äù poirot shook his forefinger so fiercely at me that i quailed
before it . ‚Äúbeware ! peril to the detective who says: ‚Äòit is so small‚Äîit
does not matter . it will not agree . i will forget it .‚Äô that way lies
confusion ! everything matters .‚Äù

‚Äúi know . you always told me that . that‚Äôs why i have gone into all the
details of this thing whether they seemed to me relevant or not .‚Äù

‚Äúand i am pleased with you . you have a good memory, and you have given
me the facts faithfully . of the order in which you present them, i say
nothing‚Äîtruly, it is deplorable ! but i make allowances‚Äîyou are upset .
to that i attribute the circumstance that you have omitted one fact of
paramount importance .‚Äù

‚Äúwhat is that ?‚Äù i asked .

‚Äúyou have not told me if mrs . inglethorp ate well last night .‚Äù

i stared at him . surely the war had affected the little man‚Äôs brain . he
was carefully engaged in brushing his coat before putting it on, and
seemed wholly engrossed in the task .

‚Äúi don‚Äôt remember,‚Äù i said . ‚Äúand, anyway, i don‚Äôt see‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù

‚Äúyou do not see ? but it is of the first importance .‚Äù

‚Äúi can‚Äôt see why,‚Äù i said, rather nettled . ‚Äúas far as i can remember,
she didn‚Äôt eat much . she was obviously upset, and it had taken her
appetite away . that was only natural .‚Äù

‚Äúyes,‚Äù said poirot thoughtfully, ‚Äúit was only natural .‚Äù

he opened a drawer, and took out a small despatch-case, then turned to
me .

‚Äúnow i am ready . we will proceed to the ch√¢teau, and study matters on
the spot . excuse me, _mon ami_, you dressed in haste, and your tie is
on one side . permit me .‚Äù with a deft gesture, he rearranged it .

‚Äú_√áa y est !_ now, shall we start ?‚Äù

we hurried up the village, and turned in at the lodge gates . poirot
stopped for a moment, and gazed sorrowfully over the beautiful expanse
of park, still glittering with morning dew .

‚Äúso beautiful, so beautiful, and yet, the poor family, plunged in
sorrow, prostrated with grief .‚Äù

he looked at me keenly as he spoke, and i was aware that i reddened
under his prolonged gaze .

was the family prostrated by grief ? was the sorrow at mrs . inglethorp‚Äôs
death so great ? i realized that there was an emotional lack in the
atmosphere . the dead woman had not the gift of commanding love . her
death was a shock and a distress, but she would not be passionately
regretted .

poirot seemed to follow my thoughts . he nodded his head gravely .

‚Äúno, you are right,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúit is not as though there was a blood
tie . she has been kind and generous to these cavendishes, but she was
not their own mother . blood tells‚Äîalways remember that‚Äîblood tells .‚Äù

‚Äúpoirot,‚Äù i said, ‚Äúi wish you would tell me why you wanted to know if
mrs . inglethorp ate well last night ? i have been turning it over in my
mind, but i can‚Äôt see how it has anything to do with the matter ?‚Äù

he was silent for a minute or two as we walked along, but finally he
said:

‚Äúi do not mind telling you‚Äîthough, as you know, it is not my habit to
explain until the end is reached . the present contention is that mrs .
inglethorp died of strychnine poisoning, presumably administered in her
coffee .‚Äù

‚Äúyes ?‚Äù

‚Äúwell, what time was the coffee served ?‚Äù

‚Äúabout eight o‚Äôclock .‚Äù

‚Äútherefore she drank it between then and half-past eight‚Äîcertainly not
much later . well, strychnine is a fairly rapid poison . its effects
would be felt very soon, probably in about an hour . yet, in mrs .
inglethorp‚Äôs case, the symptoms do not manifest themselves until five
o‚Äôclock the next morning: nine hours ! but a heavy meal, taken at about
the same time as the poison, might retard its effects, though hardly to
that extent . still, it is a possibility to be taken into account . but,
according to you, she ate very little for supper, and yet the symptoms
do not develop until early the next morning ! now that is a curious
circumstance, my friend . something may arise at the autopsy to explain
it . in the meantime, remember it .‚Äù

as we neared the house, john came out and met us . his face looked weary
and haggard .

‚Äúthis is a very dreadful business, monsieur poirot,‚Äù he said . ‚Äúhastings
has explained to you that we are anxious for no publicity ?‚Äù

‚Äúi comprehend perfectly .‚Äù

‚Äúyou see, it is only suspicion so far . we have nothing to go upon .‚Äù

‚Äúprecisely . it is a matter of precaution only .‚Äù

john turned to me, taking out his cigarette-case, and lighting a
cigarette as he did so .

‚Äúyou know that fellow inglethorp is back ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes . i met him .‚Äù

john flung the match into an adjacent flower bed, a proceeding which
was too much for poirot‚Äôs feelings . he retrieved it, and buried it
neatly .

‚Äúit‚Äôs jolly difficult to know how to treat him .‚Äù

‚Äúthat difficulty will not exist long,‚Äù pronounced poirot quietly .

john looked puzzled, not quite understanding the portent of this
cryptic saying . he handed the two keys which dr . bauerstein had given
him to me .

‚Äúshow monsieur poirot everything he wants to see .‚Äù

‚Äúthe rooms are locked ?‚Äù asked poirot .

‚Äúdr . bauerstein considered it advisable .‚Äù

poirot nodded thoughtfully .

‚Äúthen he is very sure . well, that simplifies matters for us .‚Äù

we went up together to the room of the tragedy . for convenience i
append a plan of the room and the principal articles of furniture in
it .




       02



poirot locked the door on the inside, and proceeded to a minute
inspection of the room . he darted from one object to the other with the
agility of a grasshopper . i remained by the door, fearing to obliterate
any clues . poirot, however, did not seem grateful to me for my
forbearance .

‚Äúwhat have you, my friend,‚Äù he cried, ‚Äúthat you remain there like‚Äîhow
do you say it ?‚Äîah, yes, the stuck pig ?‚Äù

i explained that i was afraid of obliterating any foot-marks .

‚Äúfoot-marks ? but what an idea ! there has already been practically an
army in the room ! what foot-marks are we likely to find ? no, come here
and aid me in my search . i will put down my little case until i need
it .‚Äù

he did so, on the round table by the window, but it was an ill-advised
proceeding; for, the top of it being loose, it tilted up, and
precipitated the despatch-case on the floor .

‚Äú_eh voil√† une table !_‚Äù cried poirot . ‚Äúah, my friend, one may live in a
big house and yet have no comfort .‚Äù

after which piece of moralizing, he resumed his search .

a small purple despatch-case, with a key in the lock, on the
writing-table, engaged his attention for some time . he took out the key
from the lock, and passed it to me to inspect . i saw nothing peculiar,
however . it was an ordinary key of the yale type, with a bit of twisted
wire through the handle .

next, he examined the framework of the door we had broken in, assuring
himself that the bolt had really been shot . then he went to the door
opposite leading into cynthia‚Äôs room . that door was also bolted, as i
had stated . however, he went to the length of unbolting it, and opening
and shutting it several times; this he did with the utmost precaution
against making any noise . suddenly something in the bolt itself seemed
to rivet his attention . he examined it carefully, and then, nimbly
whipping out a pair of small forceps from his case, he drew out some
minute particle which he carefully sealed up in a tiny envelope .

on the chest of drawers there was a tray with a spirit lamp and a small
saucepan on it . a small quantity of a dark fluid remained in the
saucepan, and an empty cup and saucer that had been drunk out of stood
near it .

i wondered how i could have been so unobservant as to overlook this .
here was a clue worth having . poirot delicately dipped his finger into
liquid, and tasted it gingerly . he made a grimace .

‚Äúcocoa‚Äîwith‚Äîi think‚Äîrum in it .‚Äù

he passed on to the debris on the floor, where the table by the bed had
been overturned . a reading-lamp, some books, matches, a bunch of keys,
and the crushed fragments of a coffee-cup lay scattered about .

‚Äúah, this is curious,‚Äù said poirot .

‚Äúi must confess that i see nothing particularly curious about it .‚Äù

‚Äúyou do not ? observe the lamp‚Äîthe chimney is broken in two places; they
lie there as they fell . but see, the coffee-cup is absolutely smashed
to powder .‚Äù

‚Äúwell,‚Äù i said wearily, ‚Äúi suppose someone must have stepped on it .‚Äù

‚Äúexactly,‚Äù said poirot, in an odd voice . ‚Äúsomeone stepped on it .‚Äù

he rose from his knees, and walked slowly across to the mantelpiece,
where he stood abstractedly fingering the ornaments, and straightening
them‚Äîa trick of his when he was agitated .

‚Äú_mon ami_,‚Äù he said, turning to me, ‚Äúsomebody stepped on that cup,
grinding it to powder, and the reason they did so was either because it
contained strychnine or‚Äîwhich is far more serious‚Äîbecause it did not
contain strychnine !‚Äù

i made no reply . i was bewildered, but i knew that it was no good
asking him to explain . in a moment or two he roused himself, and went
on with his investigations . he picked up the bunch of keys from the
floor, and twirling them round in his fingers finally selected one,
very bright and shining, which he tried in the lock of the purple
despatch-case . it fitted, and he opened the box, but after a moment‚Äôs
hesitation, closed and relocked it, and slipped the bunch of keys, as
well as the key that had originally stood in the lock, into his own
pocket .

‚Äúi have no authority to go through these papers . but it should be
done‚Äîat once !‚Äù

he then made a very careful examination of the drawers of the
wash-stand . crossing the room to the left-hand window, a round stain,
hardly visible on the dark brown carpet, seemed to interest him
particularly . he went down on his knees, examining it minutely‚Äîeven
going so far as to smell it .

finally, he poured a few drops of the cocoa into a test tube, sealing
it up carefully . his next proceeding was to take out a little notebook .

‚Äúwe have found in this room,‚Äù he said, writing busily, ‚Äúsix points of
interest . shall i enumerate them, or will you ?‚Äù

‚Äúoh, you,‚Äù i replied hastily .

‚Äúvery well, then . one, a coffee-cup that has been ground into powder;
two, a despatch-case with a key in the lock; three, a stain on the
floor .‚Äù

‚Äúthat may have been done some time ago,‚Äù i interrupted .

‚Äúno, for it is still perceptibly damp and smells of coffee . four, a
fragment of some dark green fabric‚Äîonly a thread or two, but
recognizable .‚Äù

‚Äúah !‚Äù i cried . ‚Äúthat was what you sealed up in the envelope .‚Äù

‚Äúyes . it may turn out to be a piece of one of mrs . inglethorp‚Äôs own
dresses, and quite unimportant . we shall see . five, _this_ !‚Äù with a
dramatic gesture, he pointed to a large splash of candle grease on the
floor by the writing-table . ‚Äúit must have been done since yesterday,
otherwise a good housemaid would have at once removed it with
blotting-paper and a hot iron . one of my best hats once‚Äîbut that is not
to the point .‚Äù

‚Äúit was very likely done last night . we were very agitated . or perhaps
mrs . inglethorp herself dropped her candle .‚Äù

‚Äúyou brought only one candle into the room ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes . lawrence cavendish was carrying it . but he was very upset . he
seemed to see something over here‚Äù‚Äîi indicated the mantelpiece‚Äî‚Äúthat
absolutely paralysed him .‚Äù

‚Äúthat is interesting,‚Äù said poirot quickly . ‚Äúyes, it is suggestive‚Äù‚Äîhis
eye sweeping the whole length of the wall‚Äî‚Äúbut it was not his candle
that made this great patch, for you perceive that this is white grease;
whereas monsieur lawrence‚Äôs candle, which is still on the
dressing-table, is pink . on the other hand, mrs . inglethorp had no
candlestick in the room, only a reading-lamp .‚Äù

‚Äúthen,‚Äù i said, ‚Äúwhat do you deduce ?‚Äù

to which my friend only made a rather irritating reply, urging me to
use my own natural faculties .

‚Äúand the sixth point ?‚Äù i asked . ‚Äúi suppose it is the sample of cocoa .‚Äù

‚Äúno,‚Äù said poirot thoughtfully . ‚Äúi might have included that in the six,
but i did not . no, the sixth point i will keep to myself for the
present .‚Äù

he looked quickly round the room . ‚Äúthere is nothing more to be done
here, i think, unless‚Äù‚Äîhe stared earnestly and long at the dead ashes
in the grate . ‚Äúthe fire burns‚Äîand it destroys . but by chance‚Äîthere
might be‚Äîlet us see !‚Äù

deftly, on hands and knees, he began to sort the ashes from the grate
into the fender, handling them with the greatest caution . suddenly, he
gave a faint exclamation .

‚Äúthe forceps, hastings !‚Äù

i quickly handed them to him, and with skill he extracted a small piece
of half charred paper .

‚Äúthere, _mon ami !_‚Äù he cried . ‚Äúwhat do you think of that ?‚Äù

i scrutinized the fragment . this is an exact reproduction of it:‚Äî




       03


i was puzzled . it was unusually thick, quite unlike ordinary notepaper .
suddenly an idea struck me .

‚Äúpoirot !‚Äù i cried . ‚Äúthis is a fragment of a will !‚Äù

‚Äúexactly .‚Äù

i looked up at him sharply .

‚Äúyou are not surprised ?‚Äù

‚Äúno,‚Äù he said gravely, ‚Äúi expected it .‚Äù

i relinquished the piece of paper, and watched him put it away in his
case, with the same methodical care that he bestowed on everything . my
brain was in a whirl . what was this complication of a will ? who had
destroyed it ? the person who had left the candle grease on the floor ?
obviously . but how had anyone gained admission ? all the doors had been
bolted on the inside .

‚Äúnow, my friend,‚Äù said poirot briskly, ‚Äúwe will go . i should like to
ask a few questions of the parlourmaid‚Äîdorcas, her name is, is it not ?‚Äù

we passed through alfred inglethorp‚Äôs room, and poirot delayed long
enough to make a brief but fairly comprehensive examination of it . we
went out through that door, locking both it and that of mrs .
inglethorp‚Äôs room as before .

i took him down to the boudoir which he had expressed a wish to see,
and went myself in search of dorcas .

when i returned with her, however, the boudoir was empty .

‚Äúpoirot,‚Äù i cried, ‚Äúwhere are you ?‚Äù

‚Äúi am here, my friend .‚Äù

he had stepped outside the french window, and was standing, apparently
lost in admiration, before the various shaped flower beds .

‚Äúadmirable !‚Äù he murmured . ‚Äúadmirable ! what symmetry ! observe that
crescent; and those diamonds‚Äîtheir neatness rejoices the eye . the
spacing of the plants, also, is perfect . it has been recently done; is
it not so ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes, i believe they were at it yesterday afternoon . but come in‚Äîdorcas
is here .‚Äù

‚Äú_eh bien, eh bien !_ do not grudge me a moment‚Äôs satisfaction of the
eye .‚Äù

‚Äúyes, but this affair is more important .‚Äù

‚Äúand how do you know that these fine begonias are not of equal
importance ?‚Äù

i shrugged my shoulders . there was really no arguing with him if he
chose to take that line .

‚Äúyou do not agree ? but such things have been . well, we will come in and
interview the brave dorcas .‚Äù

dorcas was standing in the boudoir, her hands folded in front of her,
and her grey hair rose in stiff waves under her white cap . she was the
very model and picture of a good old-fashioned servant .

in her attitude towards poirot, she was inclined to be suspicious, but
he soon broke down her defences . he drew forward a chair .

‚Äúpray be seated, mademoiselle .‚Äù

‚Äúthank you, sir .‚Äù

‚Äúyou have been with your mistress many years, is it not so ?‚Äù

‚Äúten years, sir .‚Äù

‚Äúthat is a long time, and very faithful service . you were much attached
to her, were you not ?‚Äù

‚Äúshe was a very good mistress to me, sir .‚Äù

‚Äúthen you will not object to answering a few questions . i put them to
you with mr . cavendish‚Äôs full approval .‚Äù

‚Äúoh, certainly, sir .‚Äù

‚Äúthen i will begin by asking you about the events of yesterday
afternoon . your mistress had a quarrel ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes, sir . but i don‚Äôt know that i ought‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù dorcas hesitated .

poirot looked at her keenly .

‚Äúmy good dorcas, it is necessary that i should know every detail of
that quarrel as fully as possible . do not think that you are betraying
your mistress‚Äôs secrets . your mistress lies dead, and it is necessary
that we should know all‚Äîif we are to avenge her . nothing can bring her
back to life, but we do hope, if there has been foul play, to bring the
murderer to justice .‚Äù

‚Äúamen to that,‚Äù said dorcas fiercely . ‚Äúand, naming no names, there‚Äôs
_one_ in this house that none of us could ever abide ! and an ill day it
was when first _he_ darkened the threshold .‚Äù

poirot waited for her indignation to subside, and then, resuming his
business-like tone, he asked:

‚Äúnow, as to this quarrel ? what is the first you heard of it ?‚Äù

‚Äúwell, sir, i happened to be going along the hall outside yesterday‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù

‚Äúwhat time was that ?‚Äù

‚Äúi couldn‚Äôt say exactly, sir, but it wasn‚Äôt tea-time by a long way .
perhaps four o‚Äôclock‚Äîor it may have been a bit later . well, sir, as i
said, i happened to be passing along, when i heard voices very loud and
angry in here . i didn‚Äôt exactly mean to listen, but‚Äîwell, there it is .
i stopped . the door was shut, but the mistress was speaking very sharp
and clear, and i heard what she said quite plainly . ‚Äòyou have lied to
me, and deceived me,‚Äô she said . i didn‚Äôt hear what mr . inglethorp
replied . he spoke a good bit lower than she did‚Äîbut she answered: ‚Äòhow
dare you ? i have kept you and clothed you and fed you ! you owe
everything to me ! and this is how you repay me ! by bringing disgrace
upon our name !‚Äô again i didn‚Äôt hear what he said, but she went on:
‚Äònothing that you can say will make any difference . i see my duty
clearly . my mind is made up . you need not think that any fear of
publicity, or scandal between husband and wife will deter me .‚Äô then i
thought i heard them coming out, so i went off quickly .‚Äù

‚Äúyou are sure it was mr . inglethorp‚Äôs voice you heard ?‚Äù

‚Äúoh, yes, sir, whose else‚Äôs could it be ?‚Äù

‚Äúwell, what happened next ?‚Äù

‚Äúlater, i came back to the hall; but it was all quiet . at five o‚Äôclock,
mrs . inglethorp rang the bell and told me to bring her a cup of
tea‚Äînothing to eat‚Äîto the boudoir . she was looking dreadful‚Äîso white
and upset . ‚Äòdorcas,‚Äô she says, ‚Äòi‚Äôve had a great shock .‚Äô ‚Äòi‚Äôm sorry for
that, m‚Äôm,‚Äô i says . ‚Äòyou‚Äôll feel better after a nice hot cup of tea,
m‚Äôm .‚Äô she had something in her hand . i don‚Äôt know if it was a letter,
or just a piece of paper, but it had writing on it, and she kept
staring at it, almost as if she couldn‚Äôt believe what was written
there . she whispered to herself, as though she had forgotten i was
there: ‚Äòthese few words‚Äîand everything‚Äôs changed .‚Äô and then she says to
me: ‚Äònever trust a man, dorcas, they‚Äôre not worth it !‚Äô i hurried off,
and got her a good strong cup of tea, and she thanked me, and said
she‚Äôd feel better when she‚Äôd drunk it . ‚Äòi don‚Äôt know what to do,‚Äô she
says . ‚Äòscandal between husband and wife is a dreadful thing, dorcas .
i‚Äôd rather hush it up if i could .‚Äô mrs . cavendish came in just then, so
she didn‚Äôt say any more .‚Äù

‚Äúshe still had the letter, or whatever it was, in her hand ?‚Äù



‚Äúyes, sir .‚Äù

‚Äúwhat would she be likely to do with it afterwards ?‚Äù

‚Äúwell, i don‚Äôt know, sir, i expect she would lock it up in that purple
case of hers .‚Äù

‚Äúis that where she usually kept important papers ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes, sir . she brought it down with her every morning, and took it up
every night .‚Äù

‚Äúwhen did she lose the key of it ?‚Äù

‚Äúshe missed it yesterday at lunch-time, sir, and told me to look
carefully for it . she was very much put out about it .‚Äù

‚Äúbut she had a duplicate key ?‚Äù

‚Äúoh, yes, sir .‚Äù

dorcas was looking very curiously at him and, to tell the truth, so was
i . what was all this about a lost key ? poirot smiled .

‚Äúnever mind, dorcas, it is my business to know things . is this the key
that was lost ?‚Äù he drew from his pocket the key that he had found in
the lock of the despatch-case upstairs .

dorcas‚Äôs eyes looked as though they would pop out of her head .

‚Äúthat‚Äôs it, sir, right enough . but where did you find it ? i looked
everywhere for it .‚Äù

‚Äúah, but you see it was not in the same place yesterday as it was
to-day . now, to pass to another subject, had your mistress a dark green
dress in her wardrobe ?‚Äù

dorcas was rather startled by the unexpected question .

‚Äúno, sir .‚Äù

‚Äúare you quite sure ?‚Äù

‚Äúoh, yes, sir .‚Äù

‚Äúhas anyone else in the house got a green dress ?‚Äù

dorcas reflected .

‚Äúmiss cynthia has a green evening dress .‚Äù

‚Äúlight or dark green ?‚Äù

‚Äúa light green, sir; a sort of chiffon, they call it .‚Äù

‚Äúah, that is not what i want . and nobody else has anything green ?‚Äù

‚Äúno, sir‚Äînot that i know of .‚Äù

poirot‚Äôs face did not betray a trace of whether he was disappointed or
otherwise . he merely remarked:

‚Äúgood, we will leave that and pass on . have you any reason to believe
that your mistress was likely to take a sleeping powder last night ?‚Äù

‚Äúnot _last_ night, sir, i know she didn‚Äôt .‚Äù

‚Äúwhy do you know so positively ?‚Äù

‚Äúbecause the box was empty . she took the last one two days ago, and she
didn‚Äôt have any more made up .‚Äù

‚Äúyou are quite sure of that ?‚Äù

‚Äúpositive, sir .‚Äù

‚Äúthen that is cleared up ! by the way, your mistress didn‚Äôt ask you to
sign any paper yesterday ?‚Äù

‚Äúto sign a paper ? no, sir .‚Äù

‚Äúwhen mr . hastings and mr . lawrence came in yesterday evening, they
found your mistress busy writing letters . i suppose you can give me no
idea to whom these letters were addressed ?‚Äù

‚Äúi‚Äôm afraid i couldn‚Äôt, sir . i was out in the evening . perhaps annie
could tell you, though she‚Äôs a careless girl . never cleared the
coffee-cups away last night . that‚Äôs what happens when i‚Äôm not here to
look after things .‚Äù

poirot lifted his hand .

‚Äúsince they have been left, dorcas, leave them a little longer, i pray
you . i should like to examine them .‚Äù

‚Äúvery well, sir .‚Äù

‚Äúwhat time did you go out last evening ?‚Äù

‚Äúabout six o‚Äôclock, sir .‚Äù

‚Äúthank you, dorcas, that is all i have to ask you .‚Äù he rose and
strolled to the window . ‚Äúi have been admiring these flower beds . how
many gardeners are employed here, by the way ?‚Äù

‚Äúonly three now, sir . five, we had, before the war, when it was kept as
a gentleman‚Äôs place should be . i wish you could have seen it then, sir .
a fair sight it was . but now there‚Äôs only old manning, and young
william, and a new-fashioned woman gardener in breeches and such-like .
ah, these are dreadful times !‚Äù

‚Äúthe good times will come again, dorcas . at least, we hope so . now,
will you send annie to me here ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes, sir . thank you, sir .‚Äù

‚Äúhow did you know that mrs . inglethorp took sleeping powders ?‚Äù i asked,
in lively curiosity, as dorcas left the room . ‚Äúand about the lost key
and the duplicate ?‚Äù

‚Äúone thing at a time . as to the sleeping powders, i knew by this .‚Äù he
suddenly produced a small cardboard box, such as chemists use for
powders .

‚Äúwhere did you find it ?‚Äù

‚Äúin the wash-stand drawer in mrs . inglethorp‚Äôs bedroom . it was number
six of my catalogue .‚Äù

‚Äúbut i suppose, as the last powder was taken two days ago, it is not of
much importance ?‚Äù

‚Äúprobably not, but do you notice anything that strikes you as peculiar
about this box ?‚Äù

i examined it closely .

‚Äúno, i can‚Äôt say that i do .‚Äù

‚Äúlook at the label .‚Äù

i read the label carefully: ‚Äú‚Äòone powder to be taken at bedtime, if
required . mrs . inglethorp .‚Äô no, i see nothing unusual .‚Äù

‚Äúnot the fact that there is no chemist‚Äôs name ?‚Äù

‚Äúah !‚Äù i exclaimed . ‚Äúto be sure, that is odd !‚Äù

‚Äúhave you ever known a chemist to send out a box like that, without his
printed name ?‚Äù

‚Äúno, i can‚Äôt say that i have .‚Äù

i was becoming quite excited, but poirot damped my ardour by remarking:

‚Äúyet the explanation is quite simple . so do not intrigue yourself, my
friend .‚Äù

an audible creaking proclaimed the approach of annie, so i had no time
to reply .

annie was a fine, strapping girl, and was evidently labouring under
intense excitement, mingled with a certain ghoulish enjoyment of the
tragedy .

poirot came to the point at once, with a business-like briskness .

‚Äúi sent for you, annie, because i thought you might be able to tell me
something about the letters mrs . inglethorp wrote last night . how many
were there ? and can you tell me any of the names and addresses ?‚Äù

annie considered .

‚Äúthere were four letters, sir . one was to miss howard, and one was to
mr . wells, the lawyer, and the other two i don‚Äôt think i remember,
sir‚Äîoh, yes, one was to ross‚Äôs, the caterers in tadminster . the other
one, i don‚Äôt remember .‚Äù

‚Äúthink,‚Äù urged poirot .

annie racked her brains in vain .

‚Äúi‚Äôm sorry, sir, but it‚Äôs clean gone . i don‚Äôt think i can have noticed
it .‚Äù

‚Äúit does not matter,‚Äù said poirot, not betraying any sign of
disappointment . ‚Äúnow i want to ask you about something else . there is a
saucepan in mrs . inglethorp‚Äôs room with some cocoa in it . did she have
that every night ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes, sir, it was put in her room every evening, and she warmed it up
in the night‚Äîwhenever she fancied it .‚Äù

‚Äúwhat was it ? plain cocoa ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes, sir, made with milk, with a teaspoonful of sugar, and two
teaspoonfuls of rum in it .‚Äù

‚Äúwho took it to her room ?‚Äù

‚Äúi did, sir .‚Äù

‚Äúalways ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes, sir .‚Äù

‚Äúat what time ?‚Äù

‚Äúwhen i went to draw the curtains, as a rule, sir .‚Äù

‚Äúdid you bring it straight up from the kitchen then ?‚Äù

‚Äúno, sir, you see there‚Äôs not much room on the gas stove, so cook used
to make it early, before putting the vegetables on for supper . then i
used to bring it up, and put it on the table by the swing door, and
take it into her room later .‚Äù

‚Äúthe swing door is in the left wing, is it not ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes, sir .‚Äù

‚Äúand the table, is it on this side of the door, or on the
farther‚Äîservants‚Äô side ?‚Äù

‚Äúit‚Äôs this side, sir .‚Äù

‚Äúwhat time did you bring it up last night ?‚Äù

‚Äúabout quarter-past seven, i should say, sir .‚Äù

‚Äúand when did you take it into mrs . inglethorp‚Äôs room ?‚Äù

‚Äúwhen i went to shut up, sir . about eight o‚Äôclock . mrs . inglethorp came
up to bed before i‚Äôd finished .‚Äù

‚Äúthen, between seven-fifteen and eight o‚Äôclock, the cocoa was standing
on the table in the left wing ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes, sir .‚Äù annie had been growing redder and redder in the face, and
now she blurted out unexpectedly:

‚Äúand if there _was_ salt in it, sir, it wasn‚Äôt me . i never took the
salt near it .‚Äù

‚Äúwhat makes you think there was salt in it ?‚Äù asked poirot .

‚Äúseeing it on the tray, sir .‚Äù

‚Äúyou saw some salt on the tray ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes . coarse kitchen salt, it looked . i never noticed it when i took
the tray up, but when i came to take it into the mistress‚Äôs room i saw
it at once, and i suppose i ought to have taken it down again, and
asked cook to make some fresh . but i was in a hurry, because dorcas was
out, and i thought maybe the cocoa itself was all right, and the salt
had only gone on the tray . so i dusted it off with my apron, and took
it in .‚Äù

i had the utmost difficulty in controlling my excitement . unknown to
herself, annie had provided us with an important piece of evidence . how
she would have gaped if she had realized that her ‚Äúcoarse kitchen salt‚Äù
was strychnine, one of the most deadly poisons known to mankind . i
marvelled at poirot‚Äôs calm . his self-control was astonishing . i awaited
his next question with impatience, but it disappointed me .

‚Äúwhen you went into mrs . inglethorp‚Äôs room, was the door leading into
miss cynthia‚Äôs room bolted ?‚Äù

‚Äúoh ! yes, sir; it always was . it had never been opened .‚Äù

‚Äúand the door into mr . inglethorp‚Äôs room ? did you notice if that was
bolted too ?‚Äù

annie hesitated .

‚Äúi couldn‚Äôt rightly say, sir; it was shut but i couldn‚Äôt say whether it
was bolted or not .‚Äù

‚Äúwhen you finally left the room, did mrs . inglethorp bolt the door
after you ?‚Äù

‚Äúno, sir, not then, but i expect she did later . she usually did lock it
at night . the door into the passage, that is .‚Äù

‚Äúdid you notice any candle grease on the floor when you did the room
yesterday ?‚Äù

‚Äúcandle grease ? oh, no, sir . mrs . inglethorp didn‚Äôt have a candle, only
a reading-lamp .‚Äù

‚Äúthen, if there had been a large patch of candle grease on the floor,
you think you would have been sure to have seen it ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes, sir, and i would have taken it out with a piece of blotting-paper
and a hot iron .‚Äù

then poirot repeated the question he had put to dorcas:

‚Äúdid your mistress ever have a green dress ?‚Äù

‚Äúno, sir .‚Äù

‚Äúnor a mantle, nor a cape, nor a‚Äîhow do you call it ?‚Äîa sports coat ?‚Äù

‚Äúnot green, sir .‚Äù

‚Äúnor anyone else in the house ?‚Äù

annie reflected .

‚Äúno, sir .‚Äù

‚Äúyou are sure of that ?‚Äù

‚Äúquite sure .‚Äù

‚Äú_bien !_ that is all i want to know . thank you very much .‚Äù

with a nervous giggle, annie took herself creakingly out of the room .
my pent-up excitement burst forth .

‚Äúpoirot,‚Äù i cried, ‚Äúi congratulate you ! this is a great discovery .‚Äù

‚Äúwhat is a great discovery ?‚Äù

‚Äúwhy, that it was the cocoa and not the coffee that was poisoned . that
explains everything ! of course it did not take effect until the early
morning, since the cocoa was only drunk in the middle of the night .‚Äù

‚Äúso you think that the cocoa‚Äîmark well what i say, hastings, the
_cocoa_‚Äîcontained strychnine ?‚Äù

‚Äúof course ! that salt on the tray, what else could it have been ?‚Äù

‚Äúit might have been salt,‚Äù replied poirot placidly .

i shrugged my shoulders . if he was going to take the matter that way,
it was no good arguing with him . the idea crossed my mind, not for the
first time, that poor old poirot was growing old . privately i thought
it lucky that he had associated with him someone of a more receptive
type of mind .

poirot was surveying me with quietly twinkling eyes .

‚Äúyou are not pleased with me, _mon ami ?_‚Äù

‚Äúmy dear poirot,‚Äù i said coldly, ‚Äúit is not for me to dictate to you .
you have a right to your own opinion, just as i have to mine .‚Äù

‚Äúa most admirable sentiment,‚Äù remarked poirot, rising briskly to his
feet . ‚Äúnow i have finished with this room . by the way, whose is the
smaller desk in the corner ?‚Äù

‚Äúmr . inglethorp‚Äôs .‚Äù

‚Äúah !‚Äù he tried the roll top tentatively . ‚Äúlocked . but perhaps one of
mrs . inglethorp‚Äôs keys would open it .‚Äù he tried several, twisting and
turning them with a practiced hand, and finally uttering an ejaculation
of satisfaction . ‚Äú_voil√† !_ it is not the key, but it will open it at a
pinch .‚Äù he slid back the roll top, and ran a rapid eye over the neatly
filed papers . to my surprise, he did not examine them, merely remarking
approvingly as he relocked the desk: ‚Äúdecidedly, he is a man of method,
this mr . inglethorp !‚Äù

a ‚Äúman of method‚Äù was, in poirot‚Äôs estimation, the highest praise that
could be bestowed on any individual .

i felt that my friend was not what he had been as he rambled on
disconnectedly:

‚Äúthere were no stamps in his desk, but there might have been, eh, _mon
ami ?_ there might have been ? yes‚Äù‚Äîhis eyes wandered round the
room‚Äî‚Äúthis boudoir has nothing more to tell us . it did not yield much .
only this .‚Äù

he pulled a crumpled envelope out of his pocket, and tossed it over to
me . it was rather a curious document . a plain, dirty looking old
envelope with a few words scrawled across it, apparently at random . the
following is a facsimile of it .




       04








chapter v . ‚Äúit isn‚Äôt strychnine, is it ?‚Äù

‚Äúwhere did you find this ?‚Äù i asked poirot, in lively curiosity .

‚Äúin the waste-paper basket . you recognise the handwriting ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes, it is mrs . inglethorp‚Äôs . but what does it mean ?‚Äù

poirot shrugged his shoulders .

‚Äúi cannot say‚Äîbut it is suggestive .‚Äù

a wild idea flashed across me . was it possible that mrs . inglethorp‚Äôs
mind was deranged ? had she some fantastic idea of demoniacal
possession ? and, if that were so, was it not also possible that she
might have taken her own life ?

i was about to expound these theories to poirot, when his own words
distracted me .

‚Äúcome,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúnow to examine the coffee-cups !‚Äù

‚Äúmy dear poirot ! what on earth is the good of that, now that we know
about the cocoa ?‚Äù

‚Äúoh, _l√† l√† !_ that miserable cocoa !‚Äù cried poirot flippantly .

he laughed with apparent enjoyment, raising his arms to heaven in mock
despair, in what i could not but consider the worst possible taste .

‚Äúand, anyway,‚Äù i said, with increasing coldness, ‚Äúas mrs . inglethorp
took her coffee upstairs with her, i do not see what you expect to
find, unless you consider it likely that we shall discover a packet of
strychnine on the coffee tray !‚Äù

poirot was sobered at once .

‚Äúcome, come, my friend,‚Äù he said, slipping his arms through mine . ‚Äú_ne
vous f√¢chez pas !_ allow me to interest myself in my coffee-cups, and i
will respect your cocoa . there ! is it a bargain ?‚Äù

he was so quaintly humorous that i was forced to laugh; and we went
together to the drawing-room, where the coffee-cups and tray remained
undisturbed as we had left them .

poirot made me recapitulate the scene of the night before, listening
very carefully, and verifying the position of the various cups .

‚Äúso mrs . cavendish stood by the tray‚Äîand poured out . yes . then she came
across to the window where you sat with mademoiselle cynthia . yes . here
are the three cups . and the cup on the mantelpiece, half drunk, that
would be mr . lawrence cavendish‚Äôs . and the one on the tray ?‚Äù

‚Äújohn cavendish‚Äôs . i saw him put it down there .‚Äù

‚Äúgood . one, two, three, four, five‚Äîbut where, then, is the cup of mr .
inglethorp ?‚Äù

‚Äúhe does not take coffee .‚Äù

‚Äúthen all are accounted for . one moment, my friend .‚Äù

with infinite care, he took a drop or two from the grounds in each cup,
sealing them up in separate test tubes, tasting each in turn as he did
so . his physiognomy underwent a curious change . an expression gathered
there that i can only describe as half puzzled, and half relieved .

‚Äú_bien !_‚Äù he said at last . ‚Äúit is evident ! i had an idea‚Äîbut clearly i
was mistaken . yes, altogether i was mistaken . yet it is strange . but no
matter !‚Äù

and, with a characteristic shrug, he dismissed whatever it was that was
worrying him from his mind . i could have told him from the beginning
that this obsession of his over the coffee was bound to end in a blind
alley, but i restrained my tongue . after all, though he was old, poirot
had been a great man in his day .

‚Äúbreakfast is ready,‚Äù said john cavendish, coming in from the hall .
‚Äúyou will breakfast with us, monsieur poirot ?‚Äù

poirot acquiesced . i observed john . already he was almost restored to
his normal self . the shock of the events of the last night had upset
him temporarily, but his equable poise soon swung back to the normal .
he was a man of very little imagination, in sharp contrast with his
brother, who had, perhaps, too much .

ever since the early hours of the morning, john had been hard at work,
sending telegrams‚Äîone of the first had gone to evelyn howard‚Äîwriting
notices for the papers, and generally occupying himself with the
melancholy duties that a death entails .

‚Äúmay i ask how things are proceeding ?‚Äù he said . ‚Äúdo your investigations
point to my mother having died a natural death‚Äîor‚Äîor must we prepare
ourselves for the worst ?‚Äù

‚Äúi think, mr . cavendish,‚Äù said poirot gravely, ‚Äúthat you would do well
not to buoy yourself up with any false hopes . can you tell me the views
of the other members of the family ?‚Äù

‚Äúmy brother lawrence is convinced that we are making a fuss over
nothing . he says that everything points to its being a simple case of
heart failure .‚Äù

‚Äúhe does, does he ? that is very interesting‚Äîvery interesting,‚Äù murmured
poirot softly . ‚Äúand mrs . cavendish ?‚Äù

a faint cloud passed over john‚Äôs face .

‚Äúi have not the least idea what my wife‚Äôs views on the subject are .‚Äù

the answer brought a momentary stiffness in its train . john broke the
rather awkward silence by saying with a slight effort:

‚Äúi told you, didn‚Äôt i, that mr . inglethorp has returned ?‚Äù

poirot bent his head .

‚Äúit‚Äôs an awkward position for all of us . of course one has to treat him
as usual‚Äîbut, hang it all, one‚Äôs gorge does rise at sitting down to eat
with a possible murderer !‚Äù

poirot nodded sympathetically .

‚Äúi quite understand . it is a very difficult situation for you, mr .
cavendish . i would like to ask you one question . mr . inglethorp‚Äôs
reason for not returning last night was, i believe, that he had
forgotten the latch-key . is not that so ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes .‚Äù

‚Äúi suppose you are quite sure that the latch-key _was_ forgotten‚Äîthat
he did not take it after all ?‚Äù

‚Äúi have no idea . i never thought of looking . we always keep it in the
hall drawer . i‚Äôll go and see if it‚Äôs there now .‚Äù

poirot held up his hand with a faint smile .

‚Äúno, no, mr . cavendish, it is too late now . i am certain that you would
find it . if mr . inglethorp did take it, he has had ample time to
replace it by now .‚Äù

‚Äúbut do you think‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù

‚Äúi think nothing . if anyone had chanced to look this morning before his
return, and seen it there, it would have been a valuable point in his
favour . that is all .‚Äù

john looked perplexed .

‚Äúdo not worry,‚Äù said poirot smoothly . ‚Äúi assure you that you need not
let it trouble you . since you are so kind, let us go and have some
breakfast .‚Äù

everyone was assembled in the dining-room . under the circumstances, we
were naturally not a cheerful party . the reaction after a shock is
always trying, and i think we were all suffering from it . decorum and
good breeding naturally enjoined that our demeanour should be much as
usual, yet i could not help wondering if this self-control were really
a matter of great difficulty . there were no red eyes, no signs of
secretly indulged grief . i felt that i was right in my opinion that
dorcas was the person most affected by the personal side of the
tragedy .

i pass over alfred inglethorp, who acted the bereaved widower in a
manner that i felt to be disgusting in its hypocrisy . did he know that
we suspected him, i wondered . surely he could not be unaware of the
fact, conceal it as we would . did he feel some secret stirring of fear,
or was he confident that his crime would go unpunished ? surely the
suspicion in the atmosphere must warn him that he was already a marked
man .

but did everyone suspect him ? what about mrs . cavendish ? i watched her
as she sat at the head of the table, graceful, composed, enigmatic . in
her soft grey frock, with white ruffles at the wrists falling over her
slender hands, she looked very beautiful . when she chose, however, her
face could be sphinx-like in its inscrutability . she was very silent,
hardly opening her lips, and yet in some queer way i felt that the
great strength of her personality was dominating us all .

and little cynthia ? did she suspect ? she looked very tired and ill, i
thought . the heaviness and languor of her manner were very marked . i
asked her if she were feeling ill, and she answered frankly:

‚Äúyes, i‚Äôve got the most beastly headache .‚Äù

‚Äúhave another cup of coffee, mademoiselle ?‚Äù said poirot solicitously .
‚Äúit will revive you . it is unparalleled for the _mal de t√™te_ .‚Äù he
jumped up and took her cup .

‚Äúno sugar,‚Äù said cynthia, watching him, as he picked up the
sugar-tongs .

‚Äúno sugar ? you abandon it in the war-time, eh ?‚Äù

‚Äúno, i never take it in coffee .‚Äù

‚Äú_sacr√© !_‚Äù murmured poirot to himself, as he brought back the
replenished cup .

only i heard him, and glancing up curiously at the little man i saw
that his face was working with suppressed excitement, and his eyes were
as green as a cat‚Äôs . he had heard or seen something that had affected
him strongly‚Äîbut what was it ? i do not usually label myself as dense,
but i must confess that nothing out of the ordinary had attracted _my_
attention .

in another moment, the door opened and dorcas appeared .

‚Äúmr . wells to see you, sir,‚Äù she said to john .

i remembered the name as being that of the lawyer to whom mrs .
inglethorp had written the night before .

john rose immediately .

‚Äúshow him into my study .‚Äù then he turned to us . ‚Äúmy mother‚Äôs lawyer,‚Äù
he explained . and in a lower voice: ‚Äúhe is also coroner‚Äîyou understand .
perhaps you would like to come with me ?‚Äù

we acquiesced and followed him out of the room . john strode on ahead
and i took the opportunity of whispering to poirot:

‚Äúthere will be an inquest then ?‚Äù

poirot nodded absently . he seemed absorbed in thought; so much so that
my curiosity was aroused .

‚Äúwhat is it ? you are not attending to what i say .‚Äù

‚Äúit is true, my friend . i am much worried .‚Äù

‚Äúwhy ?‚Äù

‚Äúbecause mademoiselle cynthia does not take sugar in her coffee .‚Äù

‚Äúwhat ? you cannot be serious ?‚Äù

‚Äúbut i am most serious . ah, there is something there that i do not
understand . my instinct was right .‚Äù

‚Äúwhat instinct ?‚Äù

‚Äúthe instinct that led me to insist on examining those coffee-cups .
_chut !_ no more now !‚Äù

we followed john into his study, and he closed the door behind us .

mr . wells was a pleasant man of middle-age, with keen eyes, and the
typical lawyer‚Äôs mouth . john introduced us both, and explained the
reason of our presence .

‚Äúyou will understand, wells,‚Äù he added, ‚Äúthat this is all strictly
private . we are still hoping that there will turn out to be no need for
investigation of any kind .‚Äù

‚Äúquite so, quite so,‚Äù said mr . wells soothingly . ‚Äúi wish we could have
spared you the pain and publicity of an inquest, but of course it‚Äôs
quite unavoidable in the absence of a doctor‚Äôs certificate .‚Äù

‚Äúyes, i suppose so .‚Äù

‚Äúclever man, bauerstein . great authority on toxicology, i believe .‚Äù

‚Äúindeed,‚Äù said john with a certain stiffness in his manner . then he
added rather hesitatingly: ‚Äúshall we have to appear as witnesses‚Äîall of
us, i mean ?‚Äù

‚Äúyou, of course‚Äîand ah‚Äîer‚Äîmr .‚Äîer‚Äîinglethorp .‚Äù

a slight pause ensued before the lawyer went on in his soothing manner:

‚Äúany other evidence will be simply confirmatory, a mere matter of
form .‚Äù

‚Äúi see .‚Äù

a faint expression of relief swept over john‚Äôs face . it puzzled me, for
i saw no occasion for it .

‚Äúif you know of nothing to the contrary,‚Äù pursued mr . wells, ‚Äúi had
thought of friday . that will give us plenty of time for the doctor‚Äôs
report . the post-mortem is to take place to-night, i believe ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes .‚Äù

‚Äúthen that arrangement will suit you ?‚Äù

‚Äúperfectly .‚Äù

‚Äúi need not tell you, my dear cavendish, how distressed i am at this
most tragic affair .‚Äù

‚Äúcan you give us no help in solving it, monsieur ?‚Äù interposed poirot,
speaking for the first time since we had entered the room .

‚Äúi ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes, we heard that mrs . inglethorp wrote to you last night . you should
have received the letter this morning .‚Äù

‚Äúi did, but it contains no information . it is merely a note asking me
to call upon her this morning, as she wanted my advice on a matter of
great importance .‚Äù

‚Äúshe gave you no hint as to what that matter might be ?‚Äù

‚Äúunfortunately, no .‚Äù

‚Äúthat is a pity,‚Äù said john .

‚Äúa great pity,‚Äù agreed poirot gravely .

there was silence . poirot remained lost in thought for a few minutes .
finally he turned to the lawyer again .

‚Äúmr . wells, there is one thing i should like to ask you‚Äîthat is, if it
is not against professional etiquette . in the event of mrs .
inglethorp‚Äôs death, who would inherit her money ?‚Äù

the lawyer hesitated a moment, and then replied:

‚Äúthe knowledge will be public property very soon, so if mr . cavendish
does not object‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù

‚Äúnot at all,‚Äù interpolated john .

‚Äúi do not see any reason why i should not answer your question . by her
last will, dated august of last year, after various unimportant
legacies to servants, etc ., she gave her entire fortune to her stepson,
mr . john cavendish .‚Äù

‚Äúwas not that‚Äîpardon the question, mr . cavendish‚Äîrather unfair to her
other stepson, mr . lawrence cavendish ?‚Äù

‚Äúno, i do not think so . you see, under the terms of their father‚Äôs
will, while john inherited the property, lawrence, at his stepmother‚Äôs
death, would come into a considerable sum of money . mrs . inglethorp
left her money to her elder stepson, knowing that he would have to keep
up styles . it was, to my mind, a very fair and equitable distribution .‚Äù

poirot nodded thoughtfully .

‚Äúi see . but i am right in saying, am i not, that by your english law
that will was automatically revoked when mrs . inglethorp remarried ?‚Äù

mr . wells bowed his head .

‚Äúas i was about to proceed, monsieur poirot, that document is now null
and void .‚Äù

‚Äú_hein !_‚Äù said poirot . he reflected for a moment, and then asked: ‚Äúwas
mrs . inglethorp herself aware of that fact ?‚Äù

‚Äúi do not know . she may have been .‚Äù

‚Äúshe was,‚Äù said john unexpectedly . ‚Äúwe were discussing the matter of
wills being revoked by marriage only yesterday .‚Äù

‚Äúah ! one more question, mr . wells . you say ‚Äòher last will .‚Äô had mrs .
inglethorp, then, made several former wills ?‚Äù

‚Äúon an average, she made a new will at least once a year,‚Äù said mr .
wells imperturbably . ‚Äúshe was given to changing her mind as to her
testamentary dispositions, now benefiting one, now another member of
her family .‚Äù

‚Äúsuppose,‚Äù suggested poirot, ‚Äúthat, unknown to you, she had made a new
will in favour of someone who was not, in any sense of the word, a
member of the family‚Äîwe will say miss howard, for instance‚Äîwould you be
surprised ?‚Äù

‚Äúnot in the least .‚Äù

‚Äúah !‚Äù poirot seemed to have exhausted his questions .

i drew close to him, while john and the lawyer were debating the
question of going through mrs . inglethorp‚Äôs papers .

‚Äúdo you think mrs . inglethorp made a will leaving all her money to miss
howard ?‚Äù i asked in a low voice, with some curiosity .

poirot smiled .

‚Äúno .‚Äù

‚Äúthen why did you ask ?‚Äù

‚Äúhush !‚Äù

john cavendish had turned to poirot .

‚Äúwill you come with us, monsieur poirot ? we are going through my
mother‚Äôs papers . mr . inglethorp is quite willing to leave it entirely
to mr . wells and myself .‚Äù

‚Äúwhich simplifies matters very much,‚Äù murmured the lawyer . ‚Äúas
technically, of course, he was entitled‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù he did not finish the
sentence .

‚Äúwe will look through the desk in the boudoir first,‚Äù explained john,
‚Äúand go up to her bedroom afterwards . she kept her most important
papers in a purple despatch-case, which we must look through
carefully .‚Äù

‚Äúyes,‚Äù said the lawyer, ‚Äúit is quite possible that there may be a later
will than the one in my possession .‚Äù

‚Äúthere _is_ a later will .‚Äù it was poirot who spoke .

‚Äúwhat ?‚Äù john and the lawyer looked at him startled .

‚Äúor, rather,‚Äù pursued my friend imperturbably, ‚Äúthere _was_ one .‚Äù

‚Äúwhat do you mean‚Äîthere was one ? where is it now ?‚Äù

‚Äúburnt !‚Äù

‚Äúburnt ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes . see here .‚Äù he took out the charred fragment we had found in the
grate in mrs . inglethorp‚Äôs room, and handed it to the lawyer with a
brief explanation of when and where he had found it .

‚Äúbut possibly this is an old will ?‚Äù

‚Äúi do not think so . in fact i am almost certain that it was made no
earlier than yesterday afternoon .‚Äù

‚Äúwhat ?‚Äù ‚Äúimpossible !‚Äù broke simultaneously from both men .

poirot turned to john .

‚Äúif you will allow me to send for your gardener, i will prove it to
you .‚Äù

‚Äúoh, of course‚Äîbut i don‚Äôt see‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù

poirot raised his hand .

‚Äúdo as i ask you . afterwards you shall question as much as you please .‚Äù

‚Äúvery well .‚Äù he rang the bell .

dorcas answered it in due course .

‚Äúdorcas, will you tell manning to come round and speak to me here .‚Äù

‚Äúyes, sir .‚Äù

dorcas withdrew .

we waited in a tense silence . poirot alone seemed perfectly at his
ease, and dusted a forgotten corner of the bookcase .

the clumping of hobnailed boots on the gravel outside proclaimed the
approach of manning . john looked questioningly at poirot . the latter
nodded .

‚Äúcome inside, manning,‚Äù said john, ‚Äúi want to speak to you .‚Äù

manning came slowly and hesitatingly through the french window, and
stood as near it as he could . he held his cap in his hands, twisting it
very carefully round and round . his back was much bent, though he was
probably not as old as he looked, but his eyes were sharp and
intelligent, and belied his slow and rather cautious speech .

‚Äúmanning,‚Äù said john, ‚Äúthis gentleman will put some questions to you
which i want you to answer .‚Äù

‚Äúyessir,‚Äù mumbled manning .

poirot stepped forward briskly . manning‚Äôs eye swept over him with a
faint contempt .

‚Äúyou were planting a bed of begonias round by the south side of the
house yesterday afternoon, were you not, manning ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes, sir, me and willum .‚Äù

‚Äúand mrs . inglethorp came to the window and called you, did she not ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes, sir, she did .‚Äù

‚Äútell me in your own words exactly what happened after that .‚Äù

‚Äúwell, sir, nothing much . she just told willum to go on his bicycle
down to the village, and bring back a form of will, or such-like‚Äîi
don‚Äôt know what exactly‚Äîshe wrote it down for him .‚Äù

‚Äúwell ?‚Äù

‚Äúwell, he did, sir .‚Äù

‚Äúand what happened next ?‚Äù

‚Äúwe went on with the begonias, sir .‚Äù

‚Äúdid not mrs . inglethorp call you again ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes, sir, both me and willum, she called .‚Äù

‚Äúand then ?‚Äù

‚Äúshe made us come right in, and sign our names at the bottom of a long
paper‚Äîunder where she‚Äôd signed .‚Äù

‚Äúdid you see anything of what was written above her signature ?‚Äù asked
poirot sharply .

‚Äúno, sir, there was a bit of blotting paper over that part .‚Äù

‚Äúand you signed where she told you ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes, sir, first me and then willum .‚Äù

‚Äúwhat did she do with it afterwards ?‚Äù

‚Äúwell, sir, she slipped it into a long envelope, and put it inside a
sort of purple box that was standing on the desk .‚Äù

‚Äúwhat time was it when she first called you ?‚Äù

‚Äúabout four, i should say, sir .‚Äù

‚Äúnot earlier ? couldn‚Äôt it have been about half-past three ?‚Äù

‚Äúno, i shouldn‚Äôt say so, sir . it would be more likely to be a bit after
four‚Äînot before it .‚Äù

‚Äúthank you, manning, that will do,‚Äù said poirot pleasantly .

the gardener glanced at his master, who nodded, whereupon manning
lifted a finger to his forehead with a low mumble, and backed
cautiously out of the window .

we all looked at each other .

‚Äúgood heavens !‚Äù murmured john . ‚Äúwhat an extraordinary coincidence .‚Äù

‚Äúhow‚Äîa coincidence ?‚Äù

‚Äúthat my mother should have made a will on the very day of her death !‚Äù

mr . wells cleared his throat and remarked drily:

‚Äúare you so sure it is a coincidence, cavendish ?‚Äù

‚Äúwhat do you mean ?‚Äù

‚Äúyour mother, you tell me, had a violent quarrel with‚Äîsomeone yesterday
afternoon‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù

‚Äúwhat do you mean ?‚Äù cried john again . there was a tremor in his voice,
and he had gone very pale .

‚Äúin consequence of that quarrel, your mother very suddenly and
hurriedly makes a new will . the contents of that will we shall never
know . she told no one of its provisions . this morning, no doubt, she
would have consulted me on the subject‚Äîbut she had no chance . the will
disappears, and she takes its secret with her to her grave . cavendish,
i much fear there is no coincidence there . monsieur poirot, i am sure
you agree with me that the facts are very suggestive .‚Äù

‚Äúsuggestive, or not,‚Äù interrupted john, ‚Äúwe are most grateful to
monsieur poirot for elucidating the matter . but for him, we should
never have known of this will . i suppose, i may not ask you, monsieur,
what first led you to suspect the fact ?‚Äù

poirot smiled and answered:

‚Äúa scribbled over old envelope, and a freshly planted bed of begonias .‚Äù

john, i think, would have pressed his questions further, but at that
moment the loud purr of a motor was audible, and we all turned to the
window as it swept past .

‚Äúevie !‚Äù cried john . ‚Äúexcuse me, wells .‚Äù he went hurriedly out into the
hall .

poirot looked inquiringly at me .

‚Äúmiss howard,‚Äù i explained .

‚Äúah, i am glad she has come . there is a woman with a head and a heart
too, hastings . though the good god gave her no beauty !‚Äù

i followed john‚Äôs example, and went out into the hall, where miss
howard was endeavouring to extricate herself from the voluminous mass
of veils that enveloped her head . as her eyes fell on me, a sudden pang
of guilt shot through me . this was the woman who had warned me so
earnestly, and to whose warning i had, alas, paid no heed ! how soon,
and how contemptuously, i had dismissed it from my mind . now that she
had been proved justified in so tragic a manner, i felt ashamed . she
had known alfred inglethorp only too well . i wondered whether, if she
had remained at styles, the tragedy would have taken place, or would
the man have feared her watchful eyes ?

i was relieved when she shook me by the hand, with her well remembered
painful grip . the eyes that met mine were sad, but not reproachful;
that she had been crying bitterly, i could tell by the redness of her
eyelids, but her manner was unchanged from its old gruffness .

‚Äústarted the moment i got the wire . just come off night duty . hired
car . quickest way to get here .‚Äù

‚Äúhave you had anything to eat this morning, evie ?‚Äù asked john .

‚Äúno .‚Äù

‚Äúi thought not . come along, breakfast‚Äôs not cleared away yet, and
they‚Äôll make you some fresh tea .‚Äù he turned to me . ‚Äúlook after her,
hastings, will you ? wells is waiting for me . oh, here‚Äôs monsieur
poirot . he‚Äôs helping us, you know, evie .‚Äù

miss howard shook hands with poirot, but glanced suspiciously over her
shoulder at john .

‚Äúwhat do you mean‚Äîhelping us ?‚Äù

‚Äúhelping us to investigate .‚Äù

‚Äúnothing to investigate . have they taken him to prison yet ?‚Äù

‚Äútaken who to prison ?‚Äù

‚Äúwho ? alfred inglethorp, of course !‚Äù

‚Äúmy dear evie, do be careful . lawrence is of the opinion that my mother
died from heart seizure .‚Äù

‚Äúmore fool, lawrence !‚Äù retorted miss howard . ‚Äúof course alfred
inglethorp murdered poor emily‚Äîas i always told you he would .‚Äù

‚Äúmy dear evie, don‚Äôt shout so . whatever we may think or suspect, it is
better to say as little as possible for the present . the inquest isn‚Äôt
until friday .‚Äù

‚Äúnot until fiddlesticks !‚Äù the snort miss howard gave was truly
magnificent . ‚Äúyou‚Äôre all off your heads . the man will be out of the
country by then . if he‚Äôs any sense, he won‚Äôt stay here tamely and wait
to be hanged .‚Äù

john cavendish looked at her helplessly .

‚Äúi know what it is,‚Äù she accused him, ‚Äúyou‚Äôve been listening to the
doctors . never should . what do they know ? nothing at all‚Äîor just enough
to make them dangerous . i ought to know‚Äîmy own father was a doctor .
that little wilkins is about the greatest fool that even i have ever
seen . heart seizure ! sort of thing he would say . anyone with any sense
could see at once that her husband had poisoned her . i always said he‚Äôd
murder her in her bed, poor soul . now he‚Äôs done it . and all you can do
is to murmur silly things about ‚Äòheart seizure‚Äô and ‚Äòinquest on
friday .‚Äô you ought to be ashamed of yourself, john cavendish .‚Äù

‚Äúwhat do you want me to do ?‚Äù asked john, unable to help a faint smile .
‚Äúdash it all, evie, i can‚Äôt haul him down to the local police station
by the scruff of his neck .‚Äù

‚Äúwell, you might do something . find out how he did it . he‚Äôs a crafty
beggar . dare say he soaked fly papers . ask cook if she‚Äôs missed any .‚Äù

it occurred to me very forcibly at that moment that to harbour miss
howard and alfred inglethorp under the same roof, and keep the peace
between them, was likely to prove a herculean task, and i did not envy
john . i could see by the expression of his face that he fully
appreciated the difficulty of the position . for the moment, he sought
refuge in retreat, and left the room precipitately .

dorcas brought in fresh tea . as she left the room, poirot came over
from the window where he had been standing, and sat down facing miss
howard .

‚Äúmademoiselle,‚Äù he said gravely, ‚Äúi want to ask you something .‚Äù

‚Äúask away,‚Äù said the lady, eyeing him with some disfavour .

‚Äúi want to be able to count upon your help .‚Äù

‚Äúi‚Äôll help you to hang alfred with pleasure,‚Äù she replied gruffly .
‚Äúhanging‚Äôs too good for him . ought to be drawn and quartered, like in
good old times .‚Äù

‚Äúwe are at one then,‚Äù said poirot, ‚Äúfor i, too, want to hang the
criminal .‚Äù

‚Äúalfred inglethorp ?‚Äù

‚Äúhim, or another .‚Äù

‚Äúno question of another . poor emily was never murdered until _he_ came
along . i don‚Äôt say she wasn‚Äôt surrounded by sharks‚Äîshe was . but it was
only her purse they were after . her life was safe enough . but along
comes mr . alfred inglethorp‚Äîand within two months‚Äîhey presto !‚Äù

‚Äúbelieve me, miss howard,‚Äù said poirot very earnestly, ‚Äúif mr .
inglethorp is the man, he shall not escape me . on my honour, i will
hang him as high as haman !‚Äù

‚Äúthat‚Äôs better,‚Äù said miss howard more enthusiastically .

‚Äúbut i must ask you to trust me . now your help may be very valuable to
me . i will tell you why . because, in all this house of mourning, yours
are the only eyes that have wept .‚Äù

miss howard blinked, and a new note crept into the gruffness of her
voice .

‚Äúif you mean that i was fond of her‚Äîyes, i was . you know, emily was a
selfish old woman in her way . she was very generous, but she always
wanted a return . she never let people forget what she had done for
them‚Äîand, that way she missed love . don‚Äôt think she ever realized it,
though, or felt the lack of it . hope not, anyway . i was on a different
footing . i took my stand from the first . ‚Äòso many pounds a year i‚Äôm
worth to you . well and good . but not a penny piece besides‚Äînot a pair
of gloves, nor a theatre ticket .‚Äô she didn‚Äôt understand‚Äîwas very
offended sometimes . said i was foolishly proud . it wasn‚Äôt that‚Äîbut i
couldn‚Äôt explain . anyway, i kept my self-respect . and so, out of the
whole bunch, i was the only one who could allow myself to be fond of
her . i watched over her . i guarded her from the lot of them, and then a
glib-tongued scoundrel comes along, and pooh ! all my years of devotion
go for nothing .‚Äù

poirot nodded sympathetically .

‚Äúi understand, mademoiselle, i understand all you feel . it is most
natural . you think that we are lukewarm‚Äîthat we lack fire and
energy‚Äîbut trust me, it is not so .‚Äù

john stuck his head in at this juncture, and invited us both to come up
to mrs . inglethorp‚Äôs room, as he and mr . wells had finished looking
through the desk in the boudoir .

as we went up the stairs, john looked back to the dining-room door, and
lowered his voice confidentially:

‚Äúlook here, what‚Äôs going to happen when these two meet ?‚Äù

i shook my head helplessly .

‚Äúi‚Äôve told mary to keep them apart if she can .‚Äù

‚Äúwill she be able to do so ?‚Äù

‚Äúthe lord only knows . there‚Äôs one thing, inglethorp himself won‚Äôt be
too keen on meeting her .‚Äù

‚Äúyou‚Äôve got the keys still, haven‚Äôt you, poirot ?‚Äù i asked, as we
reached the door of the locked room .

taking the keys from poirot, john unlocked it, and we all passed in .
the lawyer went straight to the desk, and john followed him .

‚Äúmy mother kept most of her important papers in this despatch-case, i
believe,‚Äù he said .

poirot drew out the small bunch of keys .

‚Äúpermit me . i locked it, out of precaution, this morning .‚Äù

‚Äúbut it‚Äôs not locked now .‚Äù

‚Äúimpossible !‚Äù

‚Äúsee .‚Äù and john lifted the lid as he spoke .

‚Äú_milles tonnerres !_‚Äù cried poirot, dumbfounded . ‚Äúand i‚Äîwho have both
the keys in my pocket !‚Äù he flung himself upon the case . suddenly he
stiffened . ‚Äú_eh voil√† une affaire !_ this lock has been forced .‚Äù

‚Äúwhat ?‚Äù

poirot laid down the case again .

‚Äúbut who forced it ? why should they ? when ? but the door was locked ?‚Äù
these exclamations burst from us disjointedly .

poirot answered them categorically‚Äîalmost mechanically .

‚Äúwho ? that is the question . why ? ah, if i only knew . when ? since i was
here an hour ago . as to the door being locked, it is a very ordinary
lock . probably any other of the doorkeys in this passage would fit it .‚Äù

we stared at one another blankly . poirot had walked over to the
mantelpiece . he was outwardly calm, but i noticed his hands, which from
long force of habit were mechanically straightening the spill vases on
the mantelpiece, were shaking violently .

‚Äúsee here, it was like this,‚Äù he said at last . ‚Äúthere was something in
that case‚Äîsome piece of evidence, slight in itself perhaps, but still
enough of a clue to connect the murderer with the crime . it was vital
to him that it should be destroyed before it was discovered and its
significance appreciated . therefore, he took the risk, the great risk,
of coming in here . finding the case locked, he was obliged to force it,
thus betraying his presence . for him to take that risk, it must have
been something of great importance .‚Äù

‚Äúbut what was it ?‚Äù

‚Äúah !‚Äù cried poirot, with a gesture of anger . ‚Äúthat, i do not know ! a
document of some kind, without doubt, possibly the scrap of paper
dorcas saw in her hand yesterday afternoon . and i‚Äî‚Äù his anger burst
forth freely‚Äî‚Äúmiserable animal that i am ! i guessed nothing ! i have
behaved like an imbecile ! i should never have left that case here . i
should have carried it away with me . ah, triple pig ! and now it is
gone . it is destroyed‚Äîbut is it destroyed ? is there not yet a chance‚Äîwe
must leave no stone unturned‚Äî‚Äù

he rushed like a madman from the room, and i followed him as soon as i
had sufficiently recovered my wits . but, by the time i had reached the
top of the stairs, he was out of sight .

mary cavendish was standing where the staircase branched, staring down
into the hall in the direction in which he had disappeared .

‚Äúwhat has happened to your extraordinary little friend, mr . hastings ?
he has just rushed past me like a mad bull .‚Äù

‚Äúhe‚Äôs rather upset about something,‚Äù i remarked feebly . i really did
not know how much poirot would wish me to disclose . as i saw a faint
smile gather on mrs . cavendish‚Äôs expressive mouth, i endeavoured to try
and turn the conversation by saying: ‚Äúthey haven‚Äôt met yet, have they ?‚Äù

‚Äúwho ?‚Äù

‚Äúmr . inglethorp and miss howard .‚Äù

she looked at me in rather a disconcerting manner .

‚Äúdo you think it would be such a disaster if they did meet ?‚Äù

‚Äúwell, don‚Äôt you ?‚Äù i said, rather taken aback .

‚Äúno .‚Äù she was smiling in her quiet way . ‚Äúi should like to see a good
flare up . it would clear the air . at present we are all thinking so
much, and saying so little .‚Äù

‚Äújohn doesn‚Äôt think so,‚Äù i remarked . ‚Äúhe‚Äôs anxious to keep them apart .‚Äù

‚Äúoh, john !‚Äù

something in her tone fired me, and i blurted out:

‚Äúold john‚Äôs an awfully good sort .‚Äù

she studied me curiously for a minute or two, and then said, to my
great surprise:

‚Äúyou are loyal to your friend . i like you for that .‚Äù

‚Äúaren‚Äôt you my friend too ?‚Äù

‚Äúi am a very bad friend .‚Äù

‚Äúwhy do you say that ?‚Äù

‚Äúbecause it is true . i am charming to my friends one day, and forget
all about them the next .‚Äù

i don‚Äôt know what impelled me, but i was nettled, and i said foolishly
and not in the best of taste:

‚Äúyet you seem to be invariably charming to dr . bauerstein !‚Äù

instantly i regretted my words . her face stiffened . i had the
impression of a steel curtain coming down and blotting out the real
woman . without a word, she turned and went swiftly up the stairs,
whilst i stood like an idiot gaping after her .

i was recalled to other matters by a frightful row going on below . i
could hear poirot shouting and expounding . i was vexed to think that my
diplomacy had been in vain . the little man appeared to be taking the
whole house into his confidence, a proceeding of which i, for one,
doubted the wisdom . once again i could not help regretting that my
friend was so prone to lose his head in moments of excitement . i
stepped briskly down the stairs . the sight of me calmed poirot almost
immediately . i drew him aside .

‚Äúmy dear fellow,‚Äù i said, ‚Äúis this wise ? surely you don‚Äôt want the
whole house to know of this occurrence ? you are actually playing into
the criminal‚Äôs hands .‚Äù

‚Äúyou think so, hastings ?‚Äù

‚Äúi am sure of it .‚Äù

‚Äúwell, well, my friend, i will be guided by you .‚Äù

‚Äúgood . although, unfortunately, it is a little too late now .‚Äù

‚Äúsure .‚Äù

he looked so crestfallen and abashed that i felt quite sorry, though i
still thought my rebuke a just and wise one .

‚Äúwell,‚Äù he said at last, ‚Äúlet us go, _mon ami_ .‚Äù

‚Äúyou have finished here ?‚Äù

‚Äúfor the moment, yes . you will walk back with me to the village ?‚Äù

‚Äúwillingly .‚Äù

he picked up his little suit-case, and we went out through the open
window in the drawing-room . cynthia murdoch was just coming in, and
poirot stood aside to let her pass .

‚Äúexcuse me, mademoiselle, one minute .‚Äù

‚Äúyes ?‚Äù she turned inquiringly .

‚Äúdid you ever make up mrs . inglethorp‚Äôs medicines ?‚Äù

a slight flush rose in her face, as she answered rather constrainedly:

‚Äúno .‚Äù

‚Äúonly her powders ?‚Äù

the flush deepened as cynthia replied:

‚Äúoh, yes, i did make up some sleeping powders for her once .‚Äù

‚Äúthese ?‚Äù

poirot produced the empty box which had contained powders .

she nodded .

‚Äúcan you tell me what they were ? sulphonal ? veronal ?‚Äù

‚Äúno, they were bromide powders .‚Äù

‚Äúah ! thank you, mademoiselle; good morning .‚Äù

as we walked briskly away from the house, i glanced at him more than
once . i had often before noticed that, if anything excited him, his
eyes turned green like a cat‚Äôs . they were shining like emeralds now .

‚Äúmy friend,‚Äù he broke out at last, ‚Äúi have a little idea, a very
strange, and probably utterly impossible idea . and yet‚Äîit fits in .‚Äù

i shrugged my shoulders . i privately thought that poirot was rather too
much given to these fantastic ideas . in this case, surely, the truth
was only too plain and apparent .

‚Äúso that is the explanation of the blank label on the box,‚Äù i remarked .
‚Äúvery simple, as you said . i really wonder that i did not think of it
myself .‚Äù

poirot did not appear to be listening to me .

‚Äúthey have made one more discovery, _l√†-bas_,‚Äù he observed, jerking his
thumb over his shoulder in the direction of styles . ‚Äúmr . wells told me
as we were going upstairs .‚Äù

‚Äúwhat was it ?‚Äù

‚Äúlocked up in the desk in the boudoir, they found a will of mrs .
inglethorp‚Äôs, dated before her marriage, leaving her fortune to alfred
inglethorp . it must have been made just at the time they were engaged .
it came quite as a surprise to wells‚Äîand to john cavendish also . it was
written on one of those printed will forms, and witnessed by two of the
servants‚Äînot dorcas .‚Äù

‚Äúdid mr . inglethorp know of it ?‚Äù

‚Äúhe says not .‚Äù

‚Äúone might take that with a grain of salt,‚Äù i remarked sceptically .
‚Äúall these wills are very confusing . tell me, how did those scribbled
words on the envelope help you to discover that a will was made
yesterday afternoon ?‚Äù

poirot smiled .

‚Äú_mon ami_, have you ever, when writing a letter, been arrested by the
fact that you did not know how to spell a certain word ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes, often . i suppose everyone has .‚Äù

‚Äúexactly . and have you not, in such a case, tried the word once or
twice on the edge of the blotting-paper, or a spare scrap of paper, to
see if it looked right ? well, that is what mrs . inglethorp did . you
will notice that the word ‚Äòpossessed‚Äô is spelt first with one ‚Äòs‚Äô and
subsequently with two‚Äîcorrectly . to make sure, she had further tried it
in a sentence, thus: ‚Äòi am possessed .‚Äô now, what did that tell me ? it
told me that mrs . inglethorp had been writing the word ‚Äòpossessed‚Äô that
afternoon, and, having the fragment of paper found in the grate fresh
in my mind, the possibility of a will‚Äî(a document almost certain to
contain that word)‚Äîoccurred to me at once . this possibility was
confirmed by a further circumstance . in the general confusion, the
boudoir had not been swept that morning, and near the desk were several
traces of brown mould and earth . the weather had been perfectly fine
for some days, and no ordinary boots would have left such a heavy
deposit .

‚Äúi strolled to the window, and saw at once that the begonia beds had
been newly planted . the mould in the beds was exactly similar to that
on the floor of the boudoir, and also i learnt from you that they _had_
been planted yesterday afternoon . i was now sure that one, or possibly
both of the gardeners‚Äîfor there were two sets of footprints in the
bed‚Äîhad entered the boudoir, for if mrs . inglethorp had merely wished
to speak to them she would in all probability have stood at the window,
and they would not have come into the room at all . i was now quite
convinced that she had made a fresh will, and had called the two
gardeners in to witness her signature . events proved that i was right
in my supposition .‚Äù

‚Äúthat was very ingenious,‚Äù i could not help admitting . ‚Äúi must confess
that the conclusions i drew from those few scribbled words were quite
erroneous .‚Äù

he smiled .

‚Äúyou gave too much rein to your imagination . imagination is a good
servant, and a bad master . the simplest explanation is always the most
likely .‚Äù

‚Äúanother point‚Äîhow did you know that the key of the despatch-case had
been lost ?‚Äù

‚Äúi did not know it . it was a guess that turned out to be correct . you
observed that it had a piece of twisted wire through the handle . that
suggested to me at once that it had possibly been wrenched off a flimsy
key-ring . now, if it had been lost and recovered, mrs . inglethorp would
at once have replaced it on her bunch; but on her bunch i found what
was obviously the duplicate key, very new and bright, which led me to
the hypothesis that somebody else had inserted the original key in the
lock of the despatch-case .‚Äù

‚Äúyes,‚Äù i said, ‚Äúalfred inglethorp, without doubt .‚Äù

poirot looked at me curiously .

‚Äúyou are very sure of his guilt ?‚Äù

‚Äúwell, naturally . every fresh circumstance seems to establish it more
clearly .‚Äù

‚Äúon the contrary,‚Äù said poirot quietly, ‚Äúthere are several points in
his favour .‚Äù

‚Äúoh, come now !‚Äù

‚Äúyes .‚Äù

‚Äúi see only one .‚Äù

‚Äúand that ?‚Äù

‚Äúthat he was not in the house last night .‚Äù

‚Äú‚Äòbad shot !‚Äô as you english say ! you have chosen the one point that to
my mind tells against him .‚Äù

‚Äúhow is that ?‚Äù

‚Äúbecause if mr . inglethorp knew that his wife would be poisoned last
night, he would certainly have arranged to be away from the house . his
excuse was an obviously trumped up one . that leaves us two
possibilities: either he knew what was going to happen or he had a
reason of his own for his absence .‚Äù

‚Äúand that reason ?‚Äù i asked sceptically .

poirot shrugged his shoulders .

‚Äúhow should i know ? discreditable, without doubt . this mr . inglethorp,
i should say, is somewhat of a scoundrel‚Äîbut that does not of necessity
make him a murderer .‚Äù

i shook my head, unconvinced .

‚Äúwe do not agree, eh ?‚Äù said poirot . ‚Äúwell, let us leave it . time will
show which of us is right . now let us turn to other aspects of the
case . what do you make of the fact that all the doors of the bedroom
were bolted on the inside ?‚Äù

‚Äúwell‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù i considered . ‚Äúone must look at it logically .‚Äù

‚Äútrue .‚Äù

‚Äúi should put it this way . the doors _were_ bolted‚Äîour own eyes have
told us that‚Äîyet the presence of the candle grease on the floor, and
the destruction of the will, prove that during the night someone
entered the room . you agree so far ?‚Äù

‚Äúperfectly . put with admirable clearness . proceed .‚Äù

‚Äúwell,‚Äù i said, encouraged, ‚Äúas the person who entered did not do so by
the window, nor by miraculous means, it follows that the door must have
been opened from inside by mrs . inglethorp herself . that strengthens
the conviction that the person in question was her husband . she would
naturally open the door to her own husband .‚Äù

poirot shook his head .

‚Äúwhy should she ? she had bolted the door leading into his room‚Äîa most
unusual proceeding on her part‚Äîshe had had a most violent quarrel with
him that very afternoon . no, he was the last person she would admit .‚Äù

‚Äúbut you agree with me that the door must have been opened by mrs .
inglethorp herself ?‚Äù

‚Äúthere is another possibility . she may have forgotten to bolt the door
into the passage when she went to bed, and have got up later, towards
morning, and bolted it then .‚Äù

‚Äúpoirot, is that seriously your opinion ?‚Äù

‚Äúno, i do not say it is so, but it might be . now, to turn to another
feature, what do you make of the scrap of conversation you overheard
between mrs . cavendish and her mother-in-law ?‚Äù

‚Äúi had forgotten that,‚Äù i said thoughtfully . ‚Äúthat is as enigmatical as
ever . it seems incredible that a woman like mrs . cavendish, proud and
reticent to the last degree, should interfere so violently in what was
certainly not her affair .‚Äù

‚Äúprecisely . it was an astonishing thing for a woman of her breeding to
do .‚Äù

‚Äúit is certainly curious,‚Äù i agreed . ‚Äústill, it is unimportant, and
need not be taken into account .‚Äù

a groan burst from poirot .

‚Äúwhat have i always told you ? everything must be taken into account . if
the fact will not fit the theory‚Äîlet the theory go .‚Äù

‚Äúwell, we shall see,‚Äù i said, nettled .

‚Äúyes, we shall see .‚Äù

we had reached leastways cottage, and poirot ushered me upstairs to his
own room . he offered me one of the tiny russian cigarettes he himself
occasionally smoked . i was amused to notice that he stowed away the
used matches most carefully in a little china pot . my momentary
annoyance vanished .

poirot had placed our two chairs in front of the open window which
commanded a view of the village street . the fresh air blew in warm and
pleasant . it was going to be a hot day .

suddenly my attention was arrested by a weedy looking young man rushing
down the street at a great pace . it was the expression on his face that
was extraordinary‚Äîa curious mingling of terror and agitation .

‚Äúlook, poirot !‚Äù i said .

he leant forward .

‚Äú_tiens !_‚Äù he said . ‚Äúit is mr . mace, from the chemist‚Äôs shop . he is
coming here .‚Äù

the young man came to a halt before leastways cottage, and, after
hesitating a moment, pounded vigorously at the door .

‚Äúa little minute,‚Äù cried poirot from the window . ‚Äúi come .‚Äù

motioning to me to follow him, he ran swiftly down the stairs and
opened the door . mr . mace began at once .

‚Äúoh, mr . poirot, i‚Äôm sorry for the inconvenience, but i heard that
you‚Äôd just come back from the hall ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes, we have .‚Äù

the young man moistened his dry lips . his face was working curiously .

‚Äúit‚Äôs all over the village about old mrs . inglethorp dying so suddenly .
they do say‚Äî‚Äù he lowered his voice cautiously‚Äî‚Äúthat it‚Äôs poison ?‚Äù

poirot‚Äôs face remained quite impassive .

‚Äúonly the doctors can tell us that, mr . mace .‚Äù

‚Äúyes, exactly‚Äîof course‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù the young man hesitated, and then his
agitation was too much for him . he clutched poirot by the arm, and sank
his voice to a whisper: ‚Äújust tell me this, mr . poirot, it isn‚Äôt‚Äîit
isn‚Äôt strychnine, is it ?‚Äù

i hardly heard what poirot replied . something evidently of a
non-committal nature . the young man departed, and as he closed the door
poirot‚Äôs eyes met mine .

‚Äúyes,‚Äù he said, nodding gravely . ‚Äúhe will have evidence to give at the
inquest .‚Äù

we went slowly upstairs again . i was opening my lips, when poirot
stopped me with a gesture of his hand .

‚Äúnot now, not now, _mon ami_ . i have need of reflection . my mind is in
some disorder‚Äîwhich is not well .‚Äù

for about ten minutes he sat in dead silence, perfectly still, except
for several expressive motions of his eyebrows, and all the time his
eyes grew steadily greener . at last he heaved a deep sigh .

‚Äúit is well . the bad moment has passed . now all is arranged and
classified . one must never permit confusion . the case is not clear
yet‚Äîno . for it is of the most complicated ! it puzzles _me_ . _me_,
hercule poirot ! there are two facts of significance .‚Äù

‚Äúand what are they ?‚Äù

‚Äúthe first is the state of the weather yesterday . that is very
important .‚Äù

‚Äúbut it was a glorious day !‚Äù i interrupted . ‚Äúpoirot, you‚Äôre pulling my
leg !‚Äù

‚Äúnot at all . the thermometer registered 80 degrees in the shade . do not
forget that, my friend . it is the key to the whole riddle !‚Äù

‚Äúand the second point ?‚Äù i asked .

‚Äúthe important fact that monsieur inglethorp wears very peculiar
clothes, has a black beard, and uses glasses .‚Äù

‚Äúpoirot, i cannot believe you are serious .‚Äù

‚Äúi am absolutely serious, my friend .‚Äù

‚Äúbut this is childish !‚Äù

‚Äúno, it is very momentous .‚Äù

‚Äúand supposing the coroner‚Äôs jury returns a verdict of wilful murder
against alfred inglethorp . what becomes of your theories, then ?‚Äù

‚Äúthey would not be shaken because twelve stupid men had happened to
make a mistake ! but that will not occur . for one thing, a country jury
is not anxious to take responsibility upon itself, and mr . inglethorp
stands practically in the position of local squire . also,‚Äù he added
placidly, ‚Äú_i_ should not allow it !‚Äù

‚Äú_you_ would not allow it ?‚Äù

‚Äúno .‚Äù

i looked at the extraordinary little man, divided between annoyance and
amusement . he was so tremendously sure of himself . as though he read my
thoughts, he nodded gently .

‚Äúoh, yes, _mon ami_, i would do what i say .‚Äù he got up and laid his
hand on my shoulder . his physiognomy underwent a complete change . tears
came into his eyes . ‚Äúin all this, you see, i think of that poor mrs .
inglethorp who is dead . she was not extravagantly loved‚Äîno . but she was
very good to us belgians‚Äîi owe her a debt .‚Äù

i endeavoured to interrupt, but poirot swept on .

‚Äúlet me tell you this, hastings . she would never forgive me if i let
alfred inglethorp, her husband, be arrested _now_‚Äîwhen a word from me
could save him !‚Äù






chapter vi . the inquest

in the interval before the inquest, poirot was unfailing in his
activity . twice he was closeted with mr . wells . he also took long walks
into the country . i rather resented his not taking me into his
confidence, the more so as i could not in the least guess what he was
driving at .

it occurred to me that he might have been making inquiries at raikes‚Äôs
farm; so, finding him out when i called at leastways cottage on
wednesday evening, i walked over there by the fields, hoping to meet
him . but there was no sign of him, and i hesitated to go right up to
the farm itself . as i walked away, i met an aged rustic, who leered at
me cunningly .

‚Äúyou‚Äôm from the hall, bain‚Äôt you ?‚Äù he asked .

‚Äúyes . i‚Äôm looking for a friend of mine whom i thought might have walked
this way .‚Äù

‚Äúa little chap ? as waves his hands when he talks ? one of them belgies
from the village ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes,‚Äù i said eagerly . ‚Äúhe has been here, then ?‚Äù

‚Äúoh, ay, he‚Äôs been here, right enough . more‚Äôn once too . friend of
yours, is he ? ah, you gentlemen from the hall‚Äîyou‚Äôm a pretty lot !‚Äù and
he leered more jocosely than ever .

‚Äúwhy, do the gentlemen from the hall come here often ?‚Äù i asked, as
carelessly as i could .

he winked at me knowingly .

‚Äú_one_ does, mister . naming no names, mind . and a very liberal
gentleman too ! oh, thank you, sir, i‚Äôm sure .‚Äù

i walked on sharply . evelyn howard had been right then, and i
experienced a sharp twinge of disgust, as i thought of alfred
inglethorp‚Äôs liberality with another woman‚Äôs money . had that piquant
gipsy face been at the bottom of the crime, or was it the baser
mainspring of money ? probably a judicious mixture of both .

on one point, poirot seemed to have a curious obsession . he once or
twice observed to me that he thought dorcas must have made an error in
fixing the time of the quarrel . he suggested to her repeatedly that it
was four-thirty, and not four o‚Äôclock when she had heard the voices .

but dorcas was unshaken . quite an hour, or even more, had elapsed
between the time when she had heard the voices and five o‚Äôclock, when
she had taken tea to her mistress .

the inquest was held on friday at the stylites arms in the village .
poirot and i sat together, not being required to give evidence .

the preliminaries were gone through . the jury viewed the body, and john
cavendish gave evidence of identification .

further questioned, he described his awakening in the early hours of
the morning, and the circumstances of his mother‚Äôs death .

the medical evidence was next taken . there was a breathless hush, and
every eye was fixed on the famous london specialist, who was known to
be one of the greatest authorities of the day on the subject of
toxicology .

in a few brief words, he summed up the result of the post-mortem . shorn
of its medical phraseology and technicalities, it amounted to the fact
that mrs . inglethorp had met her death as the result of strychnine
poisoning . judging from the quantity recovered, she must have taken not
less than three-quarters of a grain of strychnine, but probably one
grain or slightly over .

‚Äúis it possible that she could have swallowed the poison by accident ?‚Äù
asked the coroner .

‚Äúi should consider it very unlikely . strychnine is not used for
domestic purposes, as some poisons are, and there are restrictions
placed on its sale .‚Äù

‚Äúdoes anything in your examination lead you to determine how the poison
was administered ?‚Äù

‚Äúno .‚Äù

‚Äúyou arrived at styles before dr . wilkins, i believe ?‚Äù

‚Äúthat is so . the motor met me just outside the lodge gates, and i
hurried there as fast as i could .‚Äù

‚Äúwill you relate to us exactly what happened next ?‚Äù

‚Äúi entered mrs . inglethorp‚Äôs room . she was at that moment in a typical
tetanic convulsion . she turned towards me, and gasped out:
‚Äòalfred‚Äîalfred‚Äî‚Äî‚Äô‚Äù

‚Äúcould the strychnine have been administered in mrs . inglethorp‚Äôs
after-dinner coffee which was taken to her by her husband ?‚Äù

‚Äúpossibly, but strychnine is a fairly rapid drug in its action . the
symptoms appear from one to two hours after it has been swallowed . it
is retarded under certain conditions, none of which, however, appear to
have been present in this case . i presume mrs . inglethorp took the
coffee after dinner about eight o‚Äôclock, whereas the symptoms did not
manifest themselves until the early hours of the morning, which, on the
face of it, points to the drug having been taken much later in the
evening .‚Äù

‚Äúmrs . inglethorp was in the habit of drinking a cup of cocoa in the
middle of the night . could the strychnine have been administered in
that ?‚Äù

‚Äúno, i myself took a sample of the cocoa remaining in the saucepan and
had it analysed . there was no strychnine present .‚Äù

i heard poirot chuckle softly beside me .

‚Äúhow did you know ?‚Äù i whispered .

‚Äúlisten .‚Äù

‚Äúi should say‚Äù‚Äîthe doctor was continuing‚Äî‚Äúthat i would have been
considerably surprised at any other result .‚Äù

‚Äúwhy ?‚Äù

‚Äúsimply because strychnine has an unusually bitter taste . it can be
detected in a solution of one in seventy thousand, and can only be
disguised by some strongly flavoured substance . cocoa would be quite
powerless to mask it .‚Äù

one of the jury wanted to know if the same objection applied to coffee .

‚Äúno . coffee has a bitter taste of its own which would probably cover
the taste of strychnine .‚Äù

‚Äúthen you consider it more likely that the drug was administered in the
coffee, but that for some unknown reason its action was delayed .‚Äù

‚Äúyes, but, the cup being completely smashed, there is no possibility of
analyzing its contents .‚Äù

this concluded dr . bauerstein‚Äôs evidence . dr . wilkins corroborated it
on all points . sounded as to the possibility of suicide, he repudiated
it utterly . the deceased, he said, suffered from a weak heart, but
otherwise enjoyed perfect health, and was of a cheerful and
well-balanced disposition . she would be one of the last people to take
her own life .

lawrence cavendish was next called . his evidence was quite unimportant,
being a mere repetition of that of his brother . just as he was about to
step down, he paused, and said rather hesitatingly:

‚Äúi should like to make a suggestion if i may ?‚Äù

he glanced deprecatingly at the coroner, who replied briskly:

‚Äúcertainly, mr . cavendish, we are here to arrive at the truth of this
matter, and welcome anything that may lead to further elucidation .‚Äù

‚Äúit is just an idea of mine,‚Äù explained lawrence . ‚Äúof course i may be
quite wrong, but it still seems to me that my mother‚Äôs death might be
accounted for by natural means .‚Äù

‚Äúhow do you make that out, mr . cavendish ?‚Äù

‚Äúmy mother, at the time of her death, and for some time before it, was
taking a tonic containing strychnine .‚Äù

‚Äúah !‚Äù said the coroner .

the jury looked up, interested .

‚Äúi believe,‚Äù continued lawrence, ‚Äúthat there have been cases where the
cumulative effect of a drug, administered for some time, has ended by
causing death . also, is it not possible that she may have taken an
overdose of her medicine by accident ?‚Äù

‚Äúthis is the first we have heard of the deceased taking strychnine at
the time of her death . we are much obliged to you, mr . cavendish .‚Äù

dr . wilkins was recalled and ridiculed the idea .

‚Äúwhat mr . cavendish suggests is quite impossible . any doctor would tell
you the same . strychnine is, in a certain sense, a cumulative poison,
but it would be quite impossible for it to result in sudden death in
this way . there would have to be a long period of chronic symptoms
which would at once have attracted my attention . the whole thing is
absurd .‚Äù

‚Äúand the second suggestion ? that mrs . inglethorp may have inadvertently
taken an overdose ?‚Äù

‚Äúthree, or even four doses, would not have resulted in death . mrs .
inglethorp always had an extra large amount of medicine made up at a
time, as she dealt with coot‚Äôs, the cash chemists in tadminster . she
would have had to take very nearly the whole bottle to account for the
amount of strychnine found at the post-mortem .‚Äù

‚Äúthen you consider that we may dismiss the tonic as not being in any
way instrumental in causing her death ?‚Äù

‚Äúcertainly . the supposition is ridiculous .‚Äù

the same juryman who had interrupted before here suggested that the
chemist who made up the medicine might have committed an error .

‚Äúthat, of course, is always possible,‚Äù replied the doctor .

but dorcas, who was the next witness called, dispelled even that
possibility . the medicine had not been newly made up . on the contrary,
mrs . inglethorp had taken the last dose on the day of her death .

so the question of the tonic was finally abandoned, and the coroner
proceeded with his task . having elicited from dorcas how she had been
awakened by the violent ringing of her mistress‚Äôs bell, and had
subsequently roused the household, he passed to the subject of the
quarrel on the preceding afternoon .

dorcas‚Äôs evidence on this point was substantially what poirot and i had
already heard, so i will not repeat it here .

the next witness was mary cavendish . she stood very upright, and spoke
in a low, clear, and perfectly composed voice . in answer to the
coroner‚Äôs question, she told how, her alarm clock having aroused her at
four-thirty as usual, she was dressing, when she was startled by the
sound of something heavy falling .

‚Äúthat would have been the table by the bed ?‚Äù commented the coroner .

‚Äúi opened my door,‚Äù continued mary, ‚Äúand listened . in a few minutes a
bell rang violently . dorcas came running down and woke my husband, and
we all went to my mother-in-law‚Äôs room, but it was locked‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù

the coroner interrupted her .

‚Äúi really do not think we need trouble you further on that point . we
know all that can be known of the subsequent happenings . but i should
be obliged if you would tell us all you overheard of the quarrel the
day before .‚Äù

‚Äúi ?‚Äù

there was a faint insolence in her voice . she raised her hand and
adjusted the ruffle of lace at her neck, turning her head a little as
she did so . and quite spontaneously the thought flashed across my mind:
‚Äúshe is gaining time !‚Äù

‚Äúyes . i understand,‚Äù continued the coroner deliberately, ‚Äúthat you were
sitting reading on the bench just outside the long window of the
boudoir . that is so, is it not ?‚Äù

this was news to me and glancing sideways at poirot, i fancied that it
was news to him as well .

there was the faintest pause, the mere hesitation of a moment, before
she answered:

‚Äúyes, that is so .‚Äù

‚Äúand the boudoir window was open, was it not ?‚Äù

surely her face grew a little paler as she answered:

‚Äúyes .‚Äù

‚Äúthen you cannot have failed to hear the voices inside, especially as
they were raised in anger . in fact, they would be more audible where
you were than in the hall .‚Äù

‚Äúpossibly .‚Äù

‚Äúwill you repeat to us what you overheard of the quarrel ?‚Äù

‚Äúi really do not remember hearing anything .‚Äù

‚Äúdo you mean to say you did not hear voices ?‚Äù

‚Äúoh, yes, i heard the voices, but i did not hear what they said .‚Äù a
faint spot of colour came into her cheek . ‚Äúi am not in the habit of
listening to private conversations .‚Äù

the coroner persisted .

‚Äúand you remember nothing at all ? _nothing_, mrs . cavendish ? not one
stray word or phrase to make you realize that it _was_ a private
conversation ?‚Äù

she paused, and seemed to reflect, still outwardly as calm as ever .

‚Äúyes; i remember . mrs . inglethorp said something‚Äîi do not remember
exactly what‚Äîabout causing scandal between husband and wife .‚Äù

‚Äúah !‚Äù the coroner leant back satisfied . ‚Äúthat corresponds with what
dorcas heard . but excuse me, mrs . cavendish, although you realized it
was a private conversation, you did not move away ? you remained where
you were ?‚Äù

i caught the momentary gleam of her tawny eyes as she raised them . i
felt certain that at that moment she would willingly have torn the
little lawyer, with his insinuations, into pieces, but she replied
quietly enough:

‚Äúno . i was very comfortable where i was . i fixed my mind on my book .‚Äù

‚Äúand that is all you can tell us ?‚Äù

‚Äúthat is all .‚Äù

the examination was over, though i doubted if the coroner was entirely
satisfied with it . i think he suspected that mary cavendish could tell
more if she chose .

amy hill, shop assistant, was next called, and deposed to having sold a
will form on the afternoon of the 17th to william earl, under-gardener
at styles .

william earl and manning succeeded her, and testified to witnessing a
document . manning fixed the time at about four-thirty, william was of
the opinion that it was rather earlier .

cynthia murdoch came next . she had, however, little to tell . she had
known nothing of the tragedy, until awakened by mrs . cavendish .

‚Äúyou did not hear the table fall ?‚Äù

‚Äúno . i was fast asleep .‚Äù

the coroner smiled .

‚Äúa good conscience makes a sound sleeper,‚Äù he observed . ‚Äúthank you,
miss murdoch, that is all .‚Äù

‚Äúmiss howard .‚Äù

miss howard produced the letter written to her by mrs . inglethorp on
the evening of the 17th . poirot and i had, of course already seen it .
it added nothing to our knowledge of the tragedy . the following is a
facsimile:

styles court
essex
hand written note:

     july 17th
     my dear evelyn
     can we not bury
     the hachet ? i have
     found it hard to forgive
     the things you said
     against my dear husband
     but i am an old woman
     & very fond of you
     yours affectionately,
    emily inglethorpe


it was handed to the jury who scrutinized it attentively .

‚Äúi fear it does not help us much,‚Äù said the coroner, with a sigh .
‚Äúthere is no mention of any of the events of that afternoon .‚Äù

‚Äúplain as a pikestaff to me,‚Äù said miss howard shortly . ‚Äúit shows
clearly enough that my poor old friend had just found out she‚Äôd been
made a fool of !‚Äù

‚Äúit says nothing of the kind in the letter,‚Äù the coroner pointed out .

‚Äúno, because emily never could bear to put herself in the wrong . but
_i_ know her . she wanted me back . but she wasn‚Äôt going to own that i‚Äôd
been right . she went round about . most people do . don‚Äôt believe in it
myself .‚Äù

mr . wells smiled faintly . so, i noticed, did several of the jury . miss
howard was obviously quite a public character .

‚Äúanyway, all this tomfoolery is a great waste of time,‚Äù continued the
lady, glancing up and down the jury disparagingly . ‚Äútalk‚Äîtalk‚Äîtalk !
when all the time we know perfectly well‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù

the coroner interrupted her in an agony of apprehension:

‚Äúthank you, miss howard, that is all .‚Äù

i fancy he breathed a sigh of relief when she complied .

then came the sensation of the day . the coroner called albert mace,
chemist‚Äôs assistant .

it was our agitated young man of the pale face . in answer to the
coroner‚Äôs questions, he explained that he was a qualified pharmacist,
but had only recently come to this particular shop, as the assistant
formerly there had just been called up for the army .

these preliminaries completed, the coroner proceeded to business .

‚Äúmr . mace, have you lately sold strychnine to any unauthorized person ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes, sir .‚Äù

‚Äúwhen was this ?‚Äù

‚Äúlast monday night .‚Äù

‚Äúmonday ? not tuesday ?‚Äù

‚Äúno, sir, monday, the 16th .‚Äù

‚Äúwill you tell us to whom you sold it ?‚Äù

you could have heard a pin drop .

‚Äúyes, sir . it was to mr . inglethorp .‚Äù

every eye turned simultaneously to where alfred inglethorp was sitting,
impassive and wooden . he started slightly, as the damning words fell
from the young man‚Äôs lips . i half thought he was going to rise from his
chair, but he remained seated, although a remarkably well acted
expression of astonishment rose on his face .

‚Äúyou are sure of what you say ?‚Äù asked the coroner sternly .

‚Äúquite sure, sir .‚Äù

‚Äúare you in the habit of selling strychnine indiscriminately over the
counter ?‚Äù

the wretched young man wilted visibly under the coroner‚Äôs frown .

‚Äúoh, no, sir‚Äîof course not . but, seeing it was mr . inglethorp of the
hall, i thought there was no harm in it . he said it was to poison a
dog .‚Äù

inwardly i sympathized . it was only human nature to endeavour to please
‚Äúthe hall‚Äù‚Äîespecially when it might result in custom being transferred
from coot‚Äôs to the local establishment .

‚Äúis it not customary for anyone purchasing poison to sign a book ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes, sir, mr . inglethorp did so .‚Äù

‚Äúhave you got the book here ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes, sir .‚Äù

it was produced; and, with a few words of stern censure, the coroner
dismissed the wretched mr . mace .

then, amidst a breathless silence, alfred inglethorp was called . did he
realize, i wondered, how closely the halter was being drawn around his
neck ?

the coroner went straight to the point .

‚Äúon monday evening last, did you purchase strychnine for the purpose of
poisoning a dog ?‚Äù

inglethorp replied with perfect calmness:

‚Äúno, i did not . there is no dog at styles, except an outdoor sheepdog,
which is in perfect health .‚Äù

‚Äúyou deny absolutely having purchased strychnine from albert mace on
monday last ?‚Äù

‚Äúi do .‚Äù

‚Äúdo you also deny _this_ ?‚Äù

the coroner handed him the register in which his signature was
inscribed .

‚Äúcertainly i do . the hand-writing is quite different from mine . i will
show you .‚Äù

he took an old envelope out of his pocket, and wrote his name on it,
handing it to the jury . it was certainly utterly dissimilar .

‚Äúthen what is your explanation of mr . mace‚Äôs statement ?‚Äù

alfred inglethorp replied imperturbably:

‚Äúmr . mace must have been mistaken .‚Äù

the coroner hesitated for a moment, and then said:

‚Äúmr . inglethorp, as a mere matter of form, would you mind telling us
where you were on the evening of monday, july 16th ?‚Äù

‚Äúreally‚Äîi cannot remember .‚Äù

‚Äúthat is absurd, mr . inglethorp,‚Äù said the coroner sharply . ‚Äúthink
again .‚Äù

inglethorp shook his head .

‚Äúi cannot tell you . i have an idea that i was out walking .‚Äù

‚Äúin what direction ?‚Äù

‚Äúi really can‚Äôt remember .‚Äù

the coroner‚Äôs face grew graver .

‚Äúwere you in company with anyone ?‚Äù

‚Äúno .‚Äù

‚Äúdid you meet anyone on your walk ?‚Äù

‚Äúno .‚Äù

‚Äúthat is a pity,‚Äù said the coroner dryly . ‚Äúi am to take it then that
you decline to say where you were at the time that mr . mace positively
recognized you as entering the shop to purchase strychnine ?‚Äù

‚Äúif you like to take it that way, yes .‚Äù

‚Äúbe careful, mr . inglethorp .‚Äù

poirot was fidgeting nervously .

‚Äú_sacr√© !_‚Äù he murmured . ‚Äúdoes this imbecile of a man _want_ to be
arrested ?‚Äù

inglethorp was indeed creating a bad impression . his futile denials
would not have convinced a child . the coroner, however, passed briskly
to the next point, and poirot drew a deep breath of relief .

‚Äúyou had a discussion with your wife on tuesday afternoon ?‚Äù

‚Äúpardon me,‚Äù interrupted alfred inglethorp, ‚Äúyou have been misinformed .
i had no quarrel with my dear wife . the whole story is absolutely
untrue . i was absent from the house the entire afternoon .‚Äù

‚Äúhave you anyone who can testify to that ?‚Äù

‚Äúyou have my word,‚Äù said inglethorp haughtily .

the coroner did not trouble to reply .

‚Äúthere are two witnesses who will swear to having heard your
disagreement with mrs . inglethorp .‚Äù

‚Äúthose witnesses were mistaken .‚Äù

i was puzzled . the man spoke with such quiet assurance that i was
staggered . i looked at poirot . there was an expression of exultation on
his face which i could not understand . was he at last convinced of
alfred inglethorp‚Äôs guilt ?

‚Äúmr . inglethorp,‚Äù said the coroner, ‚Äúyou have heard your wife‚Äôs dying
words repeated here . can you explain them in any way ?‚Äù

‚Äúcertainly i can .‚Äù

‚Äúyou can ?‚Äù

‚Äúit seems to me very simple . the room was dimly lighted . dr . bauerstein
is much of my height and build, and, like me, wears a beard . in the dim
light, and suffering as she was, my poor wife mistook him for me .‚Äù

‚Äúah !‚Äù murmured poirot to himself . ‚Äúbut it is an idea, that !‚Äù

‚Äúyou think it is true ?‚Äù i whispered .

‚Äúi do not say that . but it is truly an ingenious supposition .‚Äù

‚Äúyou read my wife‚Äôs last words as an accusation‚Äù‚Äîinglethorp was
continuing‚Äî‚Äúthey were, on the contrary, an appeal to me .‚Äù

the coroner reflected a moment, then he said:

‚Äúi believe, mr . inglethorp, that you yourself poured out the coffee,
and took it to your wife that evening ?‚Äù

‚Äúi poured it out, yes . but i did not take it to her . i meant to do so,
but i was told that a friend was at the hall door, so i laid down the
coffee on the hall table . when i came through the hall again a few
minutes later, it was gone .‚Äù

this statement might, or might not, be true, but it did not seem to me
to improve matters much for inglethorp . in any case, he had had ample
time to introduce the poison .

at that point, poirot nudged me gently, indicating two men who were
sitting together near the door . one was a little, sharp, dark,
ferret-faced man, the other was tall and fair .

i questioned poirot mutely . he put his lips to my ear .

‚Äúdo you know who that little man is ?‚Äù

i shook my head .

‚Äúthat is detective inspector james japp of scotland yard‚Äîjimmy japp .
the other man is from scotland yard too . things are moving quickly, my
friend .‚Äù

i stared at the two men intently . there was certainly nothing of the
policeman about them . i should never have suspected them of being
official personages .

i was still staring, when i was startled and recalled by the verdict
being given:

‚Äúwilful murder against some person or persons unknown .‚Äù






chapter vii . poirot pays his debts

as we came out of the stylites arms, poirot drew me aside by a gentle
pressure of the arm . i understood his object . he was waiting for the
scotland yard men .

in a few moments, they emerged, and poirot at once stepped forward, and
accosted the shorter of the two .

‚Äúi fear you do not remember me, inspector japp .‚Äù

‚Äúwhy, if it isn‚Äôt mr . poirot !‚Äù cried the inspector . he turned to the
other man . ‚Äúyou‚Äôve heard me speak of mr . poirot ? it was in 1904 he and
i worked together‚Äîthe abercrombie forgery case‚Äîyou remember, he was run
down in brussels . ah, those were great days, moosier . then, do you
remember ‚Äòbaron‚Äô altara ? there was a pretty rogue for you ! he eluded
the clutches of half the police in europe . but we nailed him in
antwerp‚Äîthanks to mr . poirot here .‚Äù

as these friendly reminiscences were being indulged in, i drew nearer,
and was introduced to detective-inspector japp, who, in his turn,
introduced us both to his companion, superintendent summerhaye .

‚Äúi need hardly ask what you are doing here, gentlemen,‚Äù remarked
poirot .

japp closed one eye knowingly .

‚Äúno, indeed . pretty clear case i should say .‚Äù

but poirot answered gravely:

‚Äúthere i differ from you .‚Äù

‚Äúoh, come !‚Äù said summerhaye, opening his lips for the first time .
‚Äúsurely the whole thing is clear as daylight . the man‚Äôs caught
red-handed . how he could be such a fool beats me !‚Äù

but japp was looking attentively at poirot .

‚Äúhold your fire, summerhaye,‚Äù he remarked jocularly . ‚Äúme and moosier
here have met before‚Äîand there‚Äôs no man‚Äôs judgment i‚Äôd sooner take than
his . if i‚Äôm not greatly mistaken, he‚Äôs got something up his sleeve .
isn‚Äôt that so, moosier ?‚Äù

poirot smiled .

‚Äúi have drawn certain conclusions‚Äîyes .‚Äù

summerhaye was still looking rather sceptical, but japp continued his
scrutiny of poirot .

‚Äúit‚Äôs this way,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúso far, we‚Äôve only seen the case from the
outside . that‚Äôs where the yard‚Äôs at a disadvantage in a case of this
kind, where the murder‚Äôs only out, so to speak, after the inquest . a
lot depends on being on the spot first thing, and that‚Äôs where mr .
poirot‚Äôs had the start of us . we shouldn‚Äôt have been here as soon as
this even, if it hadn‚Äôt been for the fact that there was a smart doctor
on the spot, who gave us the tip through the coroner . but you‚Äôve been
on the spot from the first, and you may have picked up some little
hints . from the evidence at the inquest, mr . inglethorp murdered his
wife as sure as i stand here, and if anyone but you hinted the contrary
i‚Äôd laugh in his face . i must say i was surprised the jury didn‚Äôt bring
it in wilful murder against him right off . i think they would have, if
it hadn‚Äôt been for the coroner‚Äîhe seemed to be holding them back .‚Äù

‚Äúperhaps, though, you have a warrant for his arrest in your pocket
now,‚Äù suggested poirot .

a kind of wooden shutter of officialdom came down from japp‚Äôs
expressive countenance .

‚Äúperhaps i have, and perhaps i haven‚Äôt,‚Äù he remarked dryly .

poirot looked at him thoughtfully .

‚Äúi am very anxious, messieurs, that he should not be arrested .‚Äù

‚Äúi dare say,‚Äù observed summerhaye sarcastically .

japp was regarding poirot with comical perplexity .

‚Äúcan‚Äôt you go a little further, mr . poirot ? a wink‚Äôs as good as a
nod‚Äîfrom you . you‚Äôve been on the spot‚Äîand the yard doesn‚Äôt want to make
any mistakes, you know .‚Äù

poirot nodded gravely .

‚Äúthat is exactly what i thought . well, i will tell you this . use your
warrant: arrest mr . inglethorp . but it will bring you no kudos‚Äîthe case
against him will be dismissed at once ! _comme √ßa !_‚Äù and he snapped his
fingers expressively .

japp‚Äôs face grew grave, though summerhaye gave an incredulous snort .

as for me, i was literally dumb with astonishment . i could only
conclude that poirot was mad .

japp had taken out a handkerchief, and was gently dabbing his brow .

‚Äúi daren‚Äôt do it, mr . poirot . _i_‚Äôd take your word, but there‚Äôs others
over me who‚Äôll be asking what the devil i mean by it . can‚Äôt you give me
a little more to go on ?‚Äù

poirot reflected a moment .

‚Äúit can be done,‚Äù he said at last . ‚Äúi admit i do not wish it . it forces
my hand . i would have preferred to work in the dark just for the
present, but what you say is very just‚Äîthe word of a belgian policeman,
whose day is past, is not enough ! and alfred inglethorp must not be
arrested . that i have sworn, as my friend hastings here knows . see,
then, my good japp, you go at once to styles ?‚Äù

‚Äúwell, in about half an hour . we‚Äôre seeing the coroner and the doctor
first .‚Äù

‚Äúgood . call for me in passing‚Äîthe last house in the village . i will go
with you . at styles, mr . inglethorp will give you, or if he refuses‚Äîas
is probable‚Äîi will give you such proofs that shall satisfy you that the
case against him could not possibly be sustained . is that a bargain ?‚Äù

‚Äúthat‚Äôs a bargain,‚Äù said japp heartily . ‚Äúand, on behalf of the yard,
i‚Äôm much obliged to you, though i‚Äôm bound to confess i can‚Äôt at present
see the faintest possible loop-hole in the evidence, but you always
were a marvel ! so long, then, moosier .‚Äù

the two detectives strode away, summerhaye with an incredulous grin on
his face .

‚Äúwell, my friend,‚Äù cried poirot, before i could get in a word, ‚Äúwhat do
you think ? _mon dieu !_ i had some warm moments in that court; i did not
figure to myself that the man would be so pig-headed as to refuse to
say anything at all . decidedly, it was the policy of an imbecile .‚Äù

‚Äúh‚Äôm ! there are other explanations besides that of imbecility,‚Äù i
remarked . ‚Äúfor, if the case against him is true, how could he defend
himself except by silence ?‚Äù

‚Äúwhy, in a thousand ingenious ways,‚Äù cried poirot . ‚Äúsee; say that it is
i who have committed this murder, i can think of seven most plausible
stories ! far more convincing than mr . inglethorp‚Äôs stony denials !‚Äù

i could not help laughing .

‚Äúmy dear poirot, i am sure you are capable of thinking of seventy ! but,
seriously, in spite of what i heard you say to the detectives, you
surely cannot still believe in the possibility of alfred inglethorp‚Äôs
innocence ?‚Äù

‚Äúwhy not now as much as before ? nothing has changed .‚Äù

‚Äúbut the evidence is so conclusive .‚Äù

‚Äúyes, too conclusive .‚Äù

we turned in at the gate of leastways cottage, and proceeded up the now
familiar stairs .

‚Äúyes, yes, too conclusive,‚Äù continued poirot, almost to himself . ‚Äúreal
evidence is usually vague and unsatisfactory . it has to be
examined‚Äîsifted . but here the whole thing is cut and dried . no, my
friend, this evidence has been very cleverly manufactured‚Äîso cleverly
that it has defeated its own ends .‚Äù

‚Äúhow do you make that out ?‚Äù

‚Äúbecause, so long as the evidence against him was vague and intangible,
it was very hard to disprove . but, in his anxiety, the criminal has
drawn the net so closely that one cut will set inglethorp free .‚Äù

i was silent . and in a minute or two, poirot continued:

‚Äúlet us look at the matter like this . here is a man, let us say, who
sets out to poison his wife . he has lived by his wits as the saying
goes . presumably, therefore, he has some wits . he is not altogether a
fool . well, how does he set about it ? he goes boldly to the village
chemist‚Äôs and purchases strychnine under his own name, with a trumped
up story about a dog which is bound to be proved absurd . he does not
employ the poison that night . no, he waits until he has had a violent
quarrel with her, of which the whole household is cognisant, and which
naturally directs their suspicions upon him . he prepares no defence‚Äîno
shadow of an alibi, yet he knows the chemist‚Äôs assistant must
necessarily come forward with the facts . bah ! do not ask me to believe
that any man could be so idiotic ! only a lunatic, who wished to commit
suicide by causing himself to be hanged, would act so !‚Äù

‚Äústill‚Äîi do not see‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù i began .

‚Äúneither do i see . i tell you, _mon ami_, it puzzles me . _me_‚Äîhercule
poirot !‚Äù

‚Äúbut if you believe him innocent, how do you explain his buying the
strychnine ?‚Äù

‚Äúvery simply . he did _not_ buy it .‚Äù

‚Äúbut mace recognized him !‚Äù

‚Äúi beg your pardon, he saw a man with a black beard like mr .
inglethorp‚Äôs, and wearing glasses like mr . inglethorp, and dressed in
mr . inglethorp‚Äôs rather noticeable clothes . he could not recognize a
man whom he had probably only seen in the distance, since, you
remember, he himself had only been in the village a fortnight, and mrs .
inglethorp dealt principally with coot‚Äôs in tadminster .‚Äù

‚Äúthen you think‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù

‚Äú_mon ami_, do you remember the two points i laid stress upon ? leave
the first one for the moment, what was the second ?‚Äù

‚Äúthe important fact that alfred inglethorp wears peculiar clothes, has
a black beard, and uses glasses,‚Äù i quoted .

‚Äúexactly . now suppose anyone wished to pass himself off as john or
lawrence cavendish . would it be easy ?‚Äù

‚Äúno,‚Äù i said thoughtfully . ‚Äúof course an actor‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù

but poirot cut me short ruthlessly .

‚Äúand why would it not be easy ? i will tell you, my friend: because they
are both clean-shaven men . to make up successfully as one of these two
in broad daylight, it would need an actor of genius, and a certain
initial facial resemblance . but in the case of alfred inglethorp, all
that is changed . his clothes, his beard, the glasses which hide his
eyes‚Äîthose are the salient points about his personal appearance . now,
what is the first instinct of the criminal ? to divert suspicion from
himself, is it not so ? and how can he best do that ? by throwing it on
someone else . in this instance, there was a man ready to his hand .
everybody was predisposed to believe in mr . inglethorp‚Äôs guilt . it was
a foregone conclusion that he would be suspected; but, to make it a
sure thing there must be tangible proof‚Äîsuch as the actual buying of
the poison, and that, with a man of the peculiar appearance of mr .
inglethorp, was not difficult . remember, this young mace had never
actually spoken to mr . inglethorp . how should he doubt that the man in
his clothes, with his beard and his glasses, was not alfred
inglethorp ?‚Äù

‚Äúit may be so,‚Äù i said, fascinated by poirot‚Äôs eloquence . ‚Äúbut, if that
was the case, why does he not say where he was at six o‚Äôclock on monday
evening ?‚Äù

‚Äúah, why indeed ?‚Äù said poirot, calming down . ‚Äúif he were arrested, he
probably would speak, but i do not want it to come to that . i must make
him see the gravity of his position . there is, of course, something
discreditable behind his silence . if he did not murder his wife, he is,
nevertheless, a scoundrel, and has something of his own to conceal,
quite apart from the murder .‚Äù

‚Äúwhat can it be ?‚Äù i mused, won over to poirot‚Äôs views for the moment,
although still retaining a faint conviction that the obvious deduction
was the correct one .

‚Äúcan you not guess ?‚Äù asked poirot, smiling .

‚Äúno, can you ?‚Äù

‚Äúoh, yes, i had a little idea sometime ago‚Äîand it has turned out to be
correct .‚Äù

‚Äúyou never told me,‚Äù i said reproachfully .

poirot spread out his hands apologetically .

‚Äúpardon me, _mon ami_, you were not precisely _sympathique_ .‚Äù he turned
to me earnestly . ‚Äútell me‚Äîyou see now that he must not be arrested ?‚Äù

‚Äúperhaps,‚Äù i said doubtfully, for i was really quite indifferent to the
fate of alfred inglethorp, and thought that a good fright would do him
no harm .

poirot, who was watching me intently, gave a sigh .

‚Äúcome, my friend,‚Äù he said, changing the subject, ‚Äúapart from mr .
inglethorp, how did the evidence at the inquest strike you ?‚Äù

‚Äúoh, pretty much what i expected .‚Äù

‚Äúdid nothing strike you as peculiar about it ?‚Äù

my thoughts flew to mary cavendish, and i hedged:

‚Äúin what way ?‚Äù

‚Äúwell, mr . lawrence cavendish‚Äôs evidence for instance ?‚Äù

i was relieved .

‚Äúoh, lawrence ! no, i don‚Äôt think so . he‚Äôs always a nervous chap .‚Äù

‚Äúhis suggestion that his mother might have been poisoned accidentally
by means of the tonic she was taking, that did not strike you as
strange‚Äî _hein ?_‚Äù

‚Äúno, i can‚Äôt say it did . the doctors ridiculed it of course . but it was
quite a natural suggestion for a layman to make .‚Äù

‚Äúbut monsieur lawrence is not a layman . you told me yourself that he
had started by studying medicine, and that he had taken his degree .‚Äù

‚Äúyes, that‚Äôs true . i never thought of that .‚Äù i was rather startled . ‚Äúit
_is_ odd .‚Äù

poirot nodded .

‚Äúfrom the first, his behaviour has been peculiar . of all the household,
he alone would be likely to recognize the symptoms of strychnine
poisoning, and yet we find him the only member of the family to uphold
strenuously the theory of death from natural causes . if it had been
monsieur john, i could have understood it . he has no technical
knowledge, and is by nature unimaginative . but monsieur lawrence‚Äîno !
and now, to-day, he puts forward a suggestion that he himself must have
known was ridiculous . there is food for thought in this, _mon ami !_‚Äù

‚Äúit‚Äôs very confusing,‚Äù i agreed .

‚Äúthen there is mrs . cavendish,‚Äù continued poirot . ‚Äúthat‚Äôs another who
is not telling all she knows ! what do you make of her attitude ?‚Äù

‚Äúi don‚Äôt know what to make of it . it seems inconceivable that she
should be shielding alfred inglethorp . yet that is what it looks like .‚Äù

poirot nodded reflectively .

‚Äúyes, it is queer . one thing is certain, she overheard a good deal more
of that ‚Äòprivate conversation‚Äô than she was willing to admit .‚Äù

‚Äúand yet she is the last person one would accuse of stooping to
eavesdrop !‚Äù

‚Äúexactly . one thing her evidence _has_ shown me . i made a mistake .
dorcas was quite right . the quarrel did take place earlier in the
afternoon, about four o‚Äôclock, as she said .‚Äù

i looked at him curiously . i had never understood his insistence on
that point .

‚Äúyes, a good deal that was peculiar came out to-day,‚Äù continued poirot .
‚Äúdr . bauerstein, now, what was _he_ doing up and dressed at that hour
in the morning ? it is astonishing to me that no one commented on the
fact .‚Äù

‚Äúhe has insomnia, i believe,‚Äù i said doubtfully .

‚Äúwhich is a very good, or a very bad explanation,‚Äù remarked poirot . ‚Äúit
covers everything, and explains nothing . i shall keep my eye on our
clever dr . bauerstein .‚Äù

‚Äúany more faults to find with the evidence ?‚Äù i inquired satirically .

‚Äú_mon ami_,‚Äù replied poirot gravely, ‚Äúwhen you find that people are not
telling you the truth‚Äîlook out ! now, unless i am much mistaken, at the
inquest to-day only one‚Äîat most, two persons were speaking the truth
without reservation or subterfuge .‚Äù

‚Äúoh, come now, poirot ! i won‚Äôt cite lawrence, or mrs . cavendish . but
there‚Äôs john‚Äîand miss howard, surely they were speaking the truth ?‚Äù

‚Äúboth of them, my friend ? one, i grant you, but both‚Äî‚Äî !‚Äù

his words gave me an unpleasant shock . miss howard‚Äôs evidence,
unimportant as it was, had been given in such a downright
straightforward manner that it had never occurred to me to doubt her
sincerity . still, i had a great respect for poirot‚Äôs sagacity‚Äîexcept on
the occasions when he was what i described to myself as ‚Äúfoolishly
pig-headed .‚Äù

‚Äúdo you really think so ?‚Äù i asked . ‚Äúmiss howard had always seemed to me
so essentially honest‚Äîalmost uncomfortably so .‚Äù

poirot gave me a curious look, which i could not quite fathom . he
seemed to speak, and then checked himself .

‚Äúmiss murdoch too,‚Äù i continued, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs nothing untruthful about
_her_ .‚Äù

‚Äúno . but it was strange that she never heard a sound, sleeping next
door; whereas mrs . cavendish, in the other wing of the building,
distinctly heard the table fall .‚Äù

‚Äúwell, she‚Äôs young . and she sleeps soundly .‚Äù

‚Äúah, yes, indeed ! she must be a famous sleeper, that one !‚Äù

i did not quite like the tone of his voice, but at that moment a smart
knock reached our ears, and looking out of the window we perceived the
two detectives waiting for us below .

poirot seized his hat, gave a ferocious twist to his moustache, and,
carefully brushing an imaginary speck of dust from his sleeve, motioned
me to precede him down the stairs; there we joined the detectives and
set out for styles .

i think the appearance of the two scotland yard men was rather a
shock‚Äîespecially to john, though of course after the verdict, he had
realized that it was only a matter of time . still, the presence of the
detectives brought the truth home to him more than anything else could
have done .

poirot had conferred with japp in a low tone on the way up, and it was
the latter functionary who requested that the household, with the
exception of the servants, should be assembled together in the
drawing-room . i realized the significance of this . it was up to poirot
to make his boast good .

personally, i was not sanguine . poirot might have excellent reasons for
his belief in inglethorp‚Äôs innocence, but a man of the type of
summerhaye would require tangible proofs, and these i doubted if poirot
could supply .

before very long we had all trooped into the drawing-room, the door of
which japp closed . poirot politely set chairs for everyone . the
scotland yard men were the cynosure of all eyes . i think that for the
first time we realized that the thing was not a bad dream, but a
tangible reality . we had read of such things‚Äînow we ourselves were
actors in the drama . to-morrow the daily papers, all over england,
would blazon out the news in staring headlines:

‚Äúmysterious tragedy in essex‚Äù

    ‚Äúwealthy lady poisoned‚Äù


there would be pictures of styles, snap-shots of ‚Äúthe family leaving
the inquest‚Äù‚Äîthe village photographer had not been idle ! all the things
that one had read a hundred times‚Äîthings that happen to other people,
not to oneself . and now, in this house, a murder had been committed . in
front of us were ‚Äúthe detectives in charge of the case .‚Äù the well-known
glib phraseology passed rapidly through my mind in the interval before
poirot opened the proceedings .

i think everyone was a little surprised that it should be he and not
one of the official detectives who took the initiative .

‚Äú_mesdames_ and _messieurs_,‚Äù said poirot, bowing as though he were a
celebrity about to deliver a lecture, ‚Äúi have asked you to come here
all together, for a certain object . that object, it concerns mr . alfred
inglethorp .‚Äù

inglethorp was sitting a little by himself‚Äîi think, unconsciously,
everyone had drawn his chair slightly away from him‚Äîand he gave a faint
start as poirot pronounced his name .

‚Äúmr . inglethorp,‚Äù said poirot, addressing him directly, ‚Äúa very dark
shadow is resting on this house‚Äîthe shadow of murder .‚Äù

inglethorp shook his head sadly .

‚Äúmy poor wife,‚Äù he murmured . ‚Äúpoor emily ! it is terrible .‚Äù

‚Äúi do not think, monsieur,‚Äù said poirot pointedly, ‚Äúthat you quite
realize how terrible it may be‚Äîfor you .‚Äù and as inglethorp did not
appear to understand, he added: ‚Äúmr . inglethorp, you are standing in
very grave danger .‚Äù

the two detectives fidgeted . i saw the official caution ‚Äúanything you
say will be used in evidence against you,‚Äù actually hovering on
summerhaye‚Äôs lips . poirot went on .

‚Äúdo you understand now, monsieur ?‚Äù

‚Äúno . what do you mean ?‚Äù

‚Äúi mean,‚Äù said poirot deliberately, ‚Äúthat you are suspected of
poisoning your wife .‚Äù

a little gasp ran round the circle at this plain speaking .

‚Äúgood heavens !‚Äù cried inglethorp, starting up . ‚Äúwhat a monstrous idea !
_i_‚Äîpoison my dearest emily !‚Äù

‚Äúi do not think‚Äù‚Äîpoirot watched him narrowly‚Äî‚Äúthat you quite realize
the unfavourable nature of your evidence at the inquest . mr .
inglethorp, knowing what i have now told you, do you still refuse to
say where you were at six o‚Äôclock on monday afternoon ?‚Äù

with a groan, alfred inglethorp sank down again and buried his face in
his hands . poirot approached and stood over him .

‚Äúspeak !‚Äù he cried menacingly .

with an effort, inglethorp raised his face from his hands . then, slowly
and deliberately, he shook his head .

‚Äúyou will not speak ?‚Äù

‚Äúno . i do not believe that anyone could be so monstrous as to accuse me
of what you say .‚Äù

poirot nodded thoughtfully, like a man whose mind is made up .

‚Äú_soit !_‚Äù he said . ‚Äúthen i must speak for you .‚Äù

alfred inglethorp sprang up again .

‚Äúyou ? how can you speak ? you do not know‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù he broke off abruptly .

poirot turned to face us . ‚Äú_mesdames_ and _messieurs_ ! i speak ! listen !
i, hercule poirot, affirm that the man who entered the chemist‚Äôs shop,
and purchased strychnine at six o‚Äôclock on monday last was not mr .
inglethorp, for at six o‚Äôclock on that day mr . inglethorp was escorting
mrs . raikes back to her home from a neighbouring farm . i can produce no
less than five witnesses to swear to having seen them together, either
at six or just after and, as you may know, the abbey farm, mrs .
raikes‚Äôs home, is at least two and a half miles distant from the
village . there is absolutely no question as to the alibi !‚Äù






chapter viii . fresh suspicions

there was a moment‚Äôs stupefied silence . japp, who was the least
surprised of any of us, was the first to speak .

‚Äúmy word,‚Äù he cried, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre the goods ! and no mistake, mr . poirot !
these witnesses of yours are all right, i suppose ?‚Äù

‚Äú_voil√† !_ i have prepared a list of them‚Äînames and addresses . you must
see them, of course . but you will find it all right .‚Äù

‚Äúi‚Äôm sure of that .‚Äù japp lowered his voice . ‚Äúi‚Äôm much obliged to you . a
pretty mare‚Äôs nest arresting him would have been .‚Äù he turned to
inglethorp . ‚Äúbut, if you‚Äôll excuse me, sir, why couldn‚Äôt you say all
this at the inquest ?‚Äù

‚Äúi will tell you why,‚Äù interrupted poirot . ‚Äúthere was a certain
rumour‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù

‚Äúa most malicious and utterly untrue one,‚Äù interrupted alfred
inglethorp in an agitated voice .

‚Äúand mr . inglethorp was anxious to have no scandal revived just at
present . am i right ?‚Äù

‚Äúquite right .‚Äù inglethorp nodded . ‚Äúwith my poor emily not yet buried,
can you wonder i was anxious that no more lying rumours should be
started .‚Äù

‚Äúbetween you and me, sir,‚Äù remarked japp, ‚Äúi‚Äôd sooner have any amount
of rumours than be arrested for murder . and i venture to think your
poor lady would have felt the same . and, if it hadn‚Äôt been for mr .
poirot here, arrested you would have been, as sure as eggs is eggs !‚Äù

‚Äúi was foolish, no doubt,‚Äù murmured inglethorp . ‚Äúbut you do not know,
inspector, how i have been persecuted and maligned .‚Äù and he shot a
baleful glance at evelyn howard .

‚Äúnow, sir,‚Äù said japp, turning briskly to john, ‚Äúi should like to see
the lady‚Äôs bedroom, please, and after that i‚Äôll have a little chat with
the servants . don‚Äôt you bother about anything . mr . poirot, here, will
show me the way .‚Äù

as they all went out of the room, poirot turned and made me a sign to
follow him upstairs . there he caught me by the arm, and drew me aside .

‚Äúquick, go to the other wing . stand there‚Äîjust this side of the baize
door . do not move till i come .‚Äù then, turning rapidly, he rejoined the
two detectives .

i followed his instructions, taking up my position by the baize door,
and wondering what on earth lay behind the request . why was i to stand
in this particular spot on guard ? i looked thoughtfully down the
corridor in front of me . an idea struck me . with the exception of
cynthia murdoch‚Äôs, everyone‚Äôs room was in this left wing . had that
anything to do with it ? was i to report who came or went ? i stood
faithfully at my post . the minutes passed . nobody came . nothing
happened .

it must have been quite twenty minutes before poirot rejoined me .

‚Äúyou have not stirred ?‚Äù

‚Äúno, i‚Äôve stuck here like a rock . nothing‚Äôs happened .‚Äù

‚Äúah !‚Äù was he pleased, or disappointed ? ‚Äúyou‚Äôve seen nothing at all ?‚Äù

‚Äúno .‚Äù

‚Äúbut you have probably heard something ? a big bump‚Äîeh, _mon ami ?_‚Äù

‚Äúno .‚Äù

‚Äúis it possible ? ah, but i am vexed with myself ! i am not usually
clumsy . i made but a slight gesture‚Äù‚Äîi know poirot‚Äôs gestures‚Äî‚Äúwith the
left hand, and over went the table by the bed !‚Äù

he looked so childishly vexed and crest-fallen that i hastened to
console him .

‚Äúnever mind, old chap . what does it matter ? your triumph downstairs
excited you . i can tell you, that was a surprise to us all . there must
be more in this affair of inglethorp‚Äôs with mrs . raikes than we
thought, to make him hold his tongue so persistently . what are you
going to do now ? where are the scotland yard fellows ?‚Äù

‚Äúgone down to interview the servants . i showed them all our exhibits . i
am disappointed in japp . he has no method !‚Äù

‚Äúhullo !‚Äù i said, looking out of the window . ‚Äúhere‚Äôs dr . bauerstein . i
believe you‚Äôre right about that man, poirot . i don‚Äôt like him .‚Äù

‚Äúhe is clever,‚Äù observed poirot meditatively .

‚Äúoh, clever as the devil ! i must say i was overjoyed to see him in the
plight he was in on tuesday . you never saw such a spectacle !‚Äù and i
described the doctor‚Äôs adventure . ‚Äúhe looked a regular scarecrow !
plastered with mud from head to foot .‚Äù

‚Äúyou saw him, then ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes . of course, he didn‚Äôt want to come in‚Äîit was just after dinner‚Äîbut
mr . inglethorp insisted .‚Äù

‚Äúwhat ?‚Äù poirot caught me violently by the shoulders . ‚Äúwas dr .
bauerstein here on tuesday evening ? here ? and you never told me ? why
did you not tell me ? why ? why ?‚Äù

he appeared to be in an absolute frenzy .

‚Äúmy dear poirot,‚Äù i expostulated, ‚Äúi never thought it would interest
you . i didn‚Äôt know it was of any importance .‚Äù

‚Äúimportance ? it is of the first importance ! so dr . bauerstein was here
on tuesday night‚Äîthe night of the murder . hastings, do you not see ?
that alters everything‚Äîeverything !‚Äù

i had never seen him so upset . loosening his hold of me, he
mechanically straightened a pair of candlesticks, still murmuring to
himself: ‚Äúyes, that alters everything‚Äîeverything .‚Äù

suddenly he seemed to come to a decision .

‚Äú_allons !_‚Äù he said . ‚Äúwe must act at once . where is mr . cavendish ?‚Äù

john was in the smoking-room . poirot went straight to him .

‚Äúmr . cavendish, i have some important business in tadminster . a new
clue . may i take your motor ?‚Äù

‚Äúwhy, of course . do you mean at once ?‚Äù

‚Äúif you please .‚Äù

john rang the bell, and ordered round the car . in another ten minutes,
we were racing down the park and along the high road to tadminster .

‚Äúnow, poirot,‚Äù i remarked resignedly, ‚Äúperhaps you will tell me what
all this is about ?‚Äù

‚Äúwell, _mon ami_, a good deal you can guess for yourself . of course you
realize that, now mr . inglethorp is out of it, the whole position is
greatly changed . we are face to face with an entirely new problem . we
know now that there is one person who did not buy the poison . we have
cleared away the manufactured clues . now for the real ones . i have
ascertained that anyone in the household, with the exception of mrs .
cavendish, who was playing tennis with you, could have personated mr .
inglethorp on monday evening . in the same way, we have his statement
that he put the coffee down in the hall . no one took much notice of
that at the inquest‚Äîbut now it has a very different significance . we
must find out who did take that coffee to mrs . inglethorp eventually,
or who passed through the hall whilst it was standing there . from your
account, there are only two people whom we can positively say did not
go near the coffee‚Äîmrs . cavendish, and mademoiselle cynthia .‚Äù

‚Äúyes, that is so .‚Äù i felt an inexpressible lightening of the heart .
mary cavendish could certainly not rest under suspicion .

‚Äúin clearing alfred inglethorp,‚Äù continued poirot, ‚Äúi have been obliged
to show my hand sooner than i intended . as long as i might be thought
to be pursuing him, the criminal would be off his guard . now, he will
be doubly careful . yes‚Äîdoubly careful .‚Äù he turned to me abruptly . ‚Äútell
me, hastings, you yourself‚Äîhave you no suspicions of anybody ?‚Äù

i hesitated . to tell the truth, an idea, wild and extravagant in
itself, had once or twice that morning flashed through my brain . i had
rejected it as absurd, nevertheless it persisted .

‚Äúyou couldn‚Äôt call it a suspicion,‚Äù i murmured . ‚Äúit‚Äôs so utterly
foolish .‚Äù

‚Äúcome now,‚Äù urged poirot encouragingly . ‚Äúdo not fear . speak your mind .
you should always pay attention to your instincts .‚Äù

‚Äúwell then,‚Äù i blurted out, ‚Äúit‚Äôs absurd‚Äîbut i suspect miss howard of
not telling all she knows !‚Äù

‚Äúmiss howard ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes‚Äîyou‚Äôll laugh at me‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù

‚Äúnot at all . why should i ?‚Äù

‚Äúi can‚Äôt help feeling,‚Äù i continued blunderingly; ‚Äúthat we‚Äôve rather
left her out of the possible suspects, simply on the strength of her
having been away from the place . but, after all, she was only fifteen
miles away . a car would do it in half an hour . can we say positively
that she was away from styles on the night of the murder ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes, my friend,‚Äù said poirot unexpectedly, ‚Äúwe can . one of my first
actions was to ring up the hospital where she was working .‚Äù

‚Äúwell ?‚Äù

‚Äúwell, i learnt that miss howard had been on afternoon duty on tuesday,
and that‚Äîa convoy coming in unexpectedly‚Äîshe had kindly offered to
remain on night duty, which offer was gratefully accepted . that
disposes of that .‚Äù

‚Äúoh !‚Äù i said, rather nonplussed . ‚Äúreally,‚Äù i continued, ‚Äúit‚Äôs her
extraordinary vehemence against inglethorp that started me off
suspecting her . i can‚Äôt help feeling she‚Äôd do anything against him . and
i had an idea she might know something about the destroying of the
will . she might have burnt the new one, mistaking it for the earlier
one in his favour . she is so terribly bitter against him .‚Äù

‚Äúyou consider her vehemence unnatural ?‚Äù

‚Äúy‚Äîes . she is so very violent . i wondered really whether she is quite
sane on that point .‚Äù

poirot shook his head energetically .

‚Äúno, no, you are on a wrong tack there . there is nothing weak-minded or
degenerate about miss howard . she is an excellent specimen of
well-balanced english beef and brawn . she is sanity itself .‚Äù

‚Äúyet her hatred of inglethorp seems almost a mania . my idea was‚Äîa very
ridiculous one, no doubt‚Äîthat she had intended to poison him‚Äîand that,
in some way, mrs . inglethorp got hold of it by mistake . but i don‚Äôt at
all see how it could have been done . the whole thing is absurd and
ridiculous to the last degree .‚Äù

‚Äústill you are right in one thing . it is always wise to suspect
everybody until you can prove logically, and to your own satisfaction,
that they are innocent . now, what reasons are there against miss
howard‚Äôs having deliberately poisoned mrs . inglethorp ?‚Äù

‚Äúwhy, she was devoted to her !‚Äù i exclaimed .

‚Äútcha ! tcha !‚Äù cried poirot irritably . ‚Äúyou argue like a child . if miss
howard were capable of poisoning the old lady, she would be quite
equally capable of simulating devotion . no, we must look elsewhere . you
are perfectly correct in your assumption that her vehemence against
alfred inglethorp is too violent to be natural; but you are quite wrong
in the deduction you draw from it . i have drawn my own deductions,
which i believe to be correct, but i will not speak of them at
present .‚Äù he paused a minute, then went on . ‚Äúnow, to my way of
thinking, there is one insuperable objection to miss howard‚Äôs being the
murderess .‚Äù

‚Äúand that is ?‚Äù

‚Äúthat in no possible way could mrs . inglethorp‚Äôs death benefit miss
howard . now there is no murder without a motive .‚Äù

i reflected .

‚Äúcould not mrs . inglethorp have made a will in her favour ?‚Äù

poirot shook his head .

‚Äúbut you yourself suggested that possibility to mr . wells ?‚Äù

poirot smiled .

‚Äúthat was for a reason . i did not want to mention the name of the
person who was actually in my mind . miss howard occupied very much the
same position, so i used her name instead .‚Äù

‚Äústill, mrs . inglethorp might have done so . why, that will, made on the
afternoon of her death may‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù

but poirot‚Äôs shake of the head was so energetic that i stopped .

‚Äúno, my friend . i have certain little ideas of my own about that will .
but i can tell you this much‚Äîit was not in miss howard‚Äôs favour .‚Äù

i accepted his assurance, though i did not really see how he could be
so positive about the matter .

‚Äúwell,‚Äù i said, with a sigh, ‚Äúwe will acquit miss howard, then . it is
partly your fault that i ever came to suspect her . it was what you said
about her evidence at the inquest that set me off .‚Äù

poirot looked puzzled .

‚Äúwhat did i say about her evidence at the inquest ?‚Äù

‚Äúdon‚Äôt you remember ? when i cited her and john cavendish as being above
suspicion ?‚Äù

‚Äúoh‚Äîah‚Äîyes .‚Äù he seemed a little confused, but recovered himself . ‚Äúby
the way, hastings, there is something i want you to do for me .‚Äù

‚Äúcertainly . what is it ?‚Äù

‚Äúnext time you happen to be alone with lawrence cavendish, i want you
to say this to him . ‚Äòi have a message for you, from poirot . he says:
‚Äúfind the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace !‚Äù‚Äô nothing more .
nothing less .‚Äù

‚Äú‚Äòfind the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace .‚Äô is that
right ?‚Äù i asked, much mystified .

‚Äúexcellent .‚Äù

‚Äúbut what does it mean ?‚Äù

‚Äúah, that i will leave you to find out . you have access to the facts .
just say that to him, and see what he says .‚Äù

‚Äúvery well‚Äîbut it‚Äôs all extremely mysterious .‚Äù

we were running into tadminster now, and poirot directed the car to the
‚Äúanalytical chemist .‚Äù

poirot hopped down briskly, and went inside . in a few minutes he was
back again .

‚Äúthere,‚Äù he said . ‚Äúthat is all my business .‚Äù

‚Äúwhat were you doing there ?‚Äù i asked, in lively curiosity .

‚Äúi left something to be analysed .‚Äù

‚Äúyes, but what ?‚Äù

‚Äúthe sample of cocoa i took from the saucepan in the bedroom .‚Äù

‚Äúbut that has already been tested !‚Äù i cried, stupefied . ‚Äúdr . bauerstein
had it tested, and you yourself laughed at the possibility of there
being strychnine in it .‚Äù

‚Äúi know dr . bauerstein had it tested,‚Äù replied poirot quietly .

‚Äúwell, then ?‚Äù

‚Äúwell, i have a fancy for having it analysed again, that is all .‚Äù

and not another word on the subject could i drag out of him .

this proceeding of poirot‚Äôs, in respect of the cocoa, puzzled me
intensely . i could see neither rhyme nor reason in it . however, my
confidence in him, which at one time had rather waned, was fully
restored since his belief in alfred inglethorp‚Äôs innocence had been so
triumphantly vindicated .

the funeral of mrs . inglethorp took place the following day, and on
monday, as i came down to a late breakfast, john drew me aside, and
informed me that mr . inglethorp was leaving that morning, to take up
his quarters at the stylites arms until he should have completed his
plans .

‚Äúand really it‚Äôs a great relief to think he‚Äôs going, hastings,‚Äù
continued my honest friend . ‚Äúit was bad enough before, when we thought
he‚Äôd done it, but i‚Äôm hanged if it isn‚Äôt worse now, when we all feel
guilty for having been so down on the fellow . the fact is, we‚Äôve
treated him abominably . of course, things did look black against him . i
don‚Äôt see how anyone could blame us for jumping to the conclusions we
did . still, there it is, we were in the wrong, and now there‚Äôs a
beastly feeling that one ought to make amends; which is difficult, when
one doesn‚Äôt like the fellow a bit better than one did before . the whole
thing‚Äôs damned awkward ! and i‚Äôm thankful he‚Äôs had the tact to take
himself off . it‚Äôs a good thing styles wasn‚Äôt the mater‚Äôs to leave to
him . couldn‚Äôt bear to think of the fellow lording it here . he‚Äôs welcome
to her money .‚Äù

‚Äúyou‚Äôll be able to keep up the place all right ?‚Äù i asked .

‚Äúoh, yes . there are the death duties, of course, but half my father‚Äôs
money goes with the place, and lawrence will stay with us for the
present, so there is his share as well . we shall be pinched at first,
of course, because, as i once told you, i am in a bit of a hole
financially myself . still, the johnnies will wait now .‚Äù

in the general relief at inglethorp‚Äôs approaching departure, we had the
most genial breakfast we had experienced since the tragedy . cynthia,
whose young spirits were naturally buoyant, was looking quite her
pretty self again, and we all, with the exception of lawrence, who
seemed unalterably gloomy and nervous, were quietly cheerful, at the
opening of a new and hopeful future .

the papers, of course, had been full of the tragedy . glaring headlines,
sandwiched biographies of every member of the household, subtle
innuendoes, the usual familiar tag about the police having a clue .
nothing was spared us . it was a slack time . the war was momentarily
inactive, and the newspapers seized with avidity on this crime in
fashionable life: ‚Äúthe mysterious affair at styles‚Äù was the topic of
the moment .

naturally it was very annoying for the cavendishes . the house was
constantly besieged by reporters, who were consistently denied
admission, but who continued to haunt the village and the grounds,
where they lay in wait with cameras, for any unwary members of the
household . we all lived in a blast of publicity . the scotland yard men
came and went, examining, questioning, lynx-eyed and reserved of
tongue . towards what end they were working, we did not know . had they
any clue, or would the whole thing remain in the category of
undiscovered crimes ?

after breakfast, dorcas came up to me rather mysteriously, and asked if
she might have a few words with me .

‚Äúcertainly . what is it, dorcas ?‚Äù

‚Äúwell, it‚Äôs just this, sir . you‚Äôll be seeing the belgian gentleman
to-day perhaps ?‚Äù i nodded . ‚Äúwell, sir, you know how he asked me so
particular if the mistress, or anyone else, had a green dress ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes, yes . you have found one ?‚Äù my interest was aroused .

‚Äúno, not that, sir . but since then i‚Äôve remembered what the young
gentlemen‚Äù‚Äîjohn and lawrence were still the ‚Äúyoung gentlemen‚Äù to
dorcas‚Äî‚Äúcall the ‚Äòdressing-up box .‚Äô it‚Äôs up in the front attic, sir . a
great chest, full of old clothes and fancy dresses, and what not . and
it came to me sudden like that there might be a green dress amongst
them . so, if you‚Äôd tell the belgian gentleman‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù

‚Äúi will tell him, dorcas,‚Äù i promised .

‚Äúthank you very much, sir . a very nice gentleman he is, sir . and quite
a different class from them two detectives from london, what goes
prying about, and asking questions . i don‚Äôt hold with foreigners as a
rule, but from what the newspapers say i make out as how these brave
belges isn‚Äôt the ordinary run of foreigners, and certainly he‚Äôs a most
polite spoken gentleman .‚Äù

dear old dorcas ! as she stood there, with her honest face upturned to
mine, i thought what a fine specimen she was of the old-fashioned
servant that is so fast dying out .

i thought i might as well go down to the village at once, and look up
poirot; but i met him half-way, coming up to the house, and at once
gave him dorcas‚Äôs message .

‚Äúah, the brave dorcas ! we will look at the chest, although‚Äîbut no
matter‚Äîwe will examine it all the same .‚Äù

we entered the house by one of the windows . there was no one in the
hall, and we went straight up to the attic .

sure enough, there was the chest, a fine old piece, all studded with
brass nails, and full to overflowing with every imaginable type of
garment .

poirot bundled everything out on the floor with scant ceremony . there
were one or two green fabrics of varying shades; but poirot shook his
head over them all . he seemed somewhat apathetic in the search, as
though he expected no great results from it . suddenly he gave an
exclamation .

‚Äúwhat is it ?‚Äù

‚Äúlook !‚Äù

the chest was nearly empty, and there, reposing right at the bottom,
was a magnificent black beard .

‚Äú_oh√≥ !_‚Äù said poirot . ‚Äú_oh√≥ !_‚Äù he turned it over in his hands,
examining it closely . ‚Äúnew,‚Äù he remarked . ‚Äúyes, quite new .‚Äù

after a moment‚Äôs hesitation, he replaced it in the chest, heaped all
the other things on top of it as before, and made his way briskly
downstairs . he went straight to the pantry, where we found dorcas
busily polishing her silver .

poirot wished her good morning with gallic politeness, and went on:

‚Äúwe have been looking through that chest, dorcas . i am much obliged to
you for mentioning it . there is, indeed, a fine collection there . are
they often used, may i ask ?‚Äù

‚Äúwell, sir, not very often nowadays, though from time to time we do
have what the young gentlemen call ‚Äòa dress-up night .‚Äô and very funny
it is sometimes, sir . mr . lawrence, he‚Äôs wonderful . most comic ! i shall
never forget the night he came down as the char of persia, i think he
called it‚Äîa sort of eastern king it was . he had the big paper knife in
his hand, and ‚Äòmind, dorcas,‚Äô he says, ‚Äòyou‚Äôll have to be very
respectful . this is my specially sharpened scimitar, and it‚Äôs off with
your head if i‚Äôm at all displeased with you !‚Äô miss cynthia, she was
what they call an apache, or some such name‚Äîa frenchified sort of
cut-throat, i take it to be . a real sight she looked . you‚Äôd never have
believed a pretty young lady like that could have made herself into
such a ruffian . nobody would have known her .‚Äù

‚Äúthese evenings must have been great fun,‚Äù said poirot genially . ‚Äúi
suppose mr . lawrence wore that fine black beard in the chest upstairs,
when he was shah of persia ?‚Äù

‚Äúhe did have a beard, sir,‚Äù replied dorcas, smiling . ‚Äúand well i know
it, for he borrowed two skeins of my black wool to make it with ! and
i‚Äôm sure it looked wonderfully natural at a distance . i didn‚Äôt know as
there was a beard up there at all . it must have been got quite lately,
i think . there was a red wig, i know, but nothing else in the way of
hair . burnt corks they use mostly‚Äîthough ‚Äòtis messy getting it off
again . miss cynthia was a nigger once, and, oh, the trouble she had .‚Äù

‚Äúso dorcas knows nothing about that black beard,‚Äù said poirot
thoughtfully, as we walked out into the hall again .

‚Äúdo you think it is _the_ one ?‚Äù i whispered eagerly .

poirot nodded .

‚Äúi do . you notice it had been trimmed ?‚Äù

‚Äúno .‚Äù

‚Äúyes . it was cut exactly the shape of mr . inglethorp‚Äôs, and i found one
or two snipped hairs . hastings, this affair is very deep .‚Äù

‚Äúwho put it in the chest, i wonder ?‚Äù

‚Äúsomeone with a good deal of intelligence,‚Äù remarked poirot dryly . ‚Äúyou
realize that he chose the one place in the house to hide it where its
presence would not be remarked ? yes, he is intelligent . but we must be
more intelligent . we must be so intelligent that he does not suspect us
of being intelligent at all .‚Äù

i acquiesced .

‚Äúthere, _mon ami_, you will be of great assistance to me .‚Äù

i was pleased with the compliment . there had been times when i hardly
thought that poirot appreciated me at my true worth .

‚Äúyes,‚Äù he continued, staring at me thoughtfully, ‚Äúyou will be
invaluable .‚Äù

this was naturally gratifying, but poirot‚Äôs next words were not so
welcome .

‚Äúi must have an ally in the house,‚Äù he observed reflectively .

‚Äúyou have me,‚Äù i protested .

‚Äútrue, but you are not sufficient .‚Äù

i was hurt, and showed it . poirot hurried to explain himself .

‚Äúyou do not quite take my meaning . you are known to be working with me .
i want somebody who is not associated with us in any way .‚Äù

‚Äúoh, i see . how about john ?‚Äù

‚Äúno, i think not .‚Äù

‚Äúthe dear fellow isn‚Äôt perhaps very bright,‚Äù i said thoughtfully .

‚Äúhere comes miss howard,‚Äù said poirot suddenly . ‚Äúshe is the very
person . but i am in her black books, since i cleared mr . inglethorp .
still, we can but try .‚Äù

with a nod that was barely civil, miss howard assented to poirot‚Äôs
request for a few minutes‚Äô conversation .

we went into the little morning-room, and poirot closed the door .

‚Äúwell, monsieur poirot,‚Äù said miss howard impatiently, ‚Äúwhat is it ? out
with it . i‚Äôm busy .‚Äù

‚Äúdo you remember, mademoiselle, that i once asked you to help me ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes, i do .‚Äù the lady nodded . ‚Äúand i told you i‚Äôd help you with
pleasure‚Äîto hang alfred inglethorp .‚Äù

‚Äúah !‚Äù poirot studied her seriously . ‚Äúmiss howard, i will ask you one
question . i beg of you to reply to it truthfully .‚Äù

‚Äúnever tell lies,‚Äù replied miss howard .

‚Äúit is this . do you still believe that mrs . inglethorp was poisoned by
her husband ?‚Äù

‚Äúwhat do you mean ?‚Äù she asked sharply . ‚Äúyou needn‚Äôt think your pretty
explanations influence me in the slightest . i‚Äôll admit that it wasn‚Äôt
he who bought strychnine at the chemist‚Äôs shop . what of that ? i dare
say he soaked fly paper, as i told you at the beginning .‚Äù

‚Äúthat is arsenic‚Äînot strychnine,‚Äù said poirot mildly .

‚Äúwhat does that matter ? arsenic would put poor emily out of the way
just as well as strychnine . if i‚Äôm convinced he did it, it doesn‚Äôt
matter a jot to me _how_ he did it .‚Äù

‚Äúexactly . _if_ you are convinced he did it,‚Äù said poirot quietly . ‚Äúi
will put my question in another form . did you ever in your heart of
hearts believe that mrs . inglethorp was poisoned by her husband ?‚Äù

‚Äúgood heavens !‚Äù cried miss howard . ‚Äúhaven‚Äôt i always told you the man
is a villain ? haven‚Äôt i always told you he would murder her in her bed ?
haven‚Äôt i always hated him like poison ?‚Äù

‚Äúexactly,‚Äù said poirot . ‚Äúthat bears out my little idea entirely .‚Äù

‚Äúwhat little idea ?‚Äù

‚Äúmiss howard, do you remember a conversation that took place on the day
of my friend‚Äôs arrival here ? he repeated it to me, and there is a
sentence of yours that has impressed me very much . do you remember
affirming that if a crime had been committed, and anyone you loved had
been murdered, you felt certain that you would know by instinct who the
criminal was, even if you were quite unable to prove it ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes, i remember saying that . i believe it too . i suppose you think it
nonsense ?‚Äù

‚Äúnot at all .‚Äù

‚Äúand yet you will pay no attention to my instinct against alfred
inglethorp .‚Äù

‚Äúno,‚Äù said poirot curtly . ‚Äúbecause your instinct is not against mr .
inglethorp .‚Äù

‚Äúwhat ?‚Äù

‚Äúno . you wish to believe he committed the crime . you believe him
capable of committing it . but your instinct tells you he did not commit
it . it tells you more‚Äîshall i go on ?‚Äù

she was staring at him, fascinated, and made a slight affirmative
movement of the hand .

‚Äúshall i tell you why you have been so vehement against mr . inglethorp ?
it is because you have been trying to believe what you wish to believe .
it is because you are trying to drown and stifle your instinct, which
tells you another name‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù

‚Äúno, no, no !‚Äù cried miss howard wildly, flinging up her hands . ‚Äúdon‚Äôt
say it ! oh, don‚Äôt say it ! it isn‚Äôt true ! it can‚Äôt be true . i don‚Äôt know
what put such a wild‚Äîsuch a dreadful‚Äîidea into my head !‚Äù

‚Äúi am right, am i not ?‚Äù asked poirot .

‚Äúyes, yes; you must be a wizard to have guessed . but it can‚Äôt be
so‚Äîit‚Äôs too monstrous, too impossible . it _must_ be alfred inglethorp .‚Äù

poirot shook his head gravely .

‚Äúdon‚Äôt ask me about it,‚Äù continued miss howard, ‚Äúbecause i shan‚Äôt tell
you . i won‚Äôt admit it, even to myself . i must be mad to think of such a
thing .‚Äù

poirot nodded, as if satisfied .

‚Äúi will ask you nothing . it is enough for me that it is as i thought .
and i‚Äîi, too, have an instinct . we are working together towards a
common end .‚Äù

‚Äúdon‚Äôt ask me to help you, because i won‚Äôt . i wouldn‚Äôt lift a finger
to‚Äîto‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù she faltered .

‚Äúyou will help me in spite of yourself . i ask you nothing‚Äîbut you will
be my ally . you will not be able to help yourself . you will do the only
thing that i want of you .‚Äù

‚Äúand that is ?‚Äù

‚Äúyou will watch !‚Äù

evelyn howard bowed her head .

‚Äúyes, i can‚Äôt help doing that . i am always watching‚Äîalways hoping i
shall be proved wrong .‚Äù

‚Äúif we are wrong, well and good,‚Äù said poirot . ‚Äúno one will be more
pleased than i shall . but, if we are right ? if we are right, miss
howard, on whose side are you then ?‚Äù

‚Äúi don‚Äôt know, i don‚Äôt know‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù

‚Äúcome now .‚Äù

‚Äúit could be hushed up .‚Äù

‚Äúthere must be no hushing up .‚Äù

‚Äúbut emily herself‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù she broke off .

‚Äúmiss howard,‚Äù said poirot gravely, ‚Äúthis is unworthy of you .‚Äù

suddenly she took her face from her hands .

‚Äúyes,‚Äù she said quietly, ‚Äúthat was not evelyn howard who spoke !‚Äù she
flung her head up proudly . ‚Äú_this_ is evelyn howard ! and she is on the
side of justice ! let the cost be what it may .‚Äù and with these words,
she walked firmly out of the room .

‚Äúthere,‚Äù said poirot, looking after her, ‚Äúgoes a very valuable ally .
that woman, hastings, has got brains as well as a heart .‚Äù

i did not reply .

‚Äúinstinct is a marvellous thing,‚Äù mused poirot . ‚Äúit can neither be
explained nor ignored .‚Äù

‚Äúyou and miss howard seem to know what you are talking about,‚Äù i
observed coldly . ‚Äúperhaps you don‚Äôt realize that _i_ am still in the
dark .‚Äù

‚Äúreally ? is that so, _mon ami ?_‚Äù

‚Äúyes . enlighten me, will you ?‚Äù

poirot studied me attentively for a moment or two . then, to my intense
surprise, he shook his head decidedly .

‚Äúno, my friend .‚Äù

‚Äúoh, look here, why not ?‚Äù

‚Äútwo is enough for a secret .‚Äù

‚Äúwell, i think it is very unfair to keep back facts from me .‚Äù

‚Äúi am not keeping back facts . every fact that i know is in your
possession . you can draw your own deductions from them . this time it is
a question of ideas .‚Äù

‚Äústill, it would be interesting to know .‚Äù

poirot looked at me very earnestly, and again shook his head .

‚Äúyou see,‚Äù he said sadly, ‚Äú_you_ have no instincts .‚Äù

‚Äúit was intelligence you were requiring just now,‚Äù i pointed out .

‚Äúthe two often go together,‚Äù said poirot enigmatically .

the remark seemed so utterly irrelevant that i did not even take the
trouble to answer it . but i decided that if i made any interesting and
important discoveries‚Äîas no doubt i should‚Äîi would keep them to myself,
and surprise poirot with the ultimate result .

there are times when it is one‚Äôs duty to assert oneself .






chapter ix . dr . bauerstein

i had had no opportunity as yet of passing on poirot‚Äôs message to
lawrence . but now, as i strolled out on the lawn, still nursing a
grudge against my friend‚Äôs high-handedness, i saw lawrence on the
croquet lawn, aimlessly knocking a couple of very ancient balls about,
with a still more ancient mallet .

it struck me that it would be a good opportunity to deliver my message .
otherwise, poirot himself might relieve me of it . it was true that i
did not quite gather its purport, but i flattered myself that by
lawrence‚Äôs reply, and perhaps a little skillful cross-examination on my
part, i should soon perceive its significance . accordingly i accosted
him .

‚Äúi‚Äôve been looking for you,‚Äù i remarked untruthfully .

‚Äúhave you ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes . the truth is, i‚Äôve got a message for you‚Äîfrom poirot .‚Äù

‚Äúyes ?‚Äù

‚Äúhe told me to wait until i was alone with you,‚Äù i said, dropping my
voice significantly, and watching him intently out of the corner of my
eye . i have always been rather good at what is called, i believe,
creating an atmosphere .

‚Äúwell ?‚Äù

there was no change of expression in the dark melancholic face . had he
any idea of what i was about to say ?

‚Äúthis is the message .‚Äù i dropped my voice still lower . ‚Äú‚Äòfind the extra
coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace .‚Äô‚Äù

‚Äúwhat on earth does he mean ?‚Äù lawrence stared at me in quite unaffected
astonishment .

‚Äúdon‚Äôt you know ?‚Äù

‚Äúnot in the least . do you ?‚Äù

i was compelled to shake my head .

‚Äúwhat extra coffee-cup ?‚Äù

‚Äúi don‚Äôt know .‚Äù

‚Äúhe‚Äôd better ask dorcas, or one of the maids, if he wants to know about
coffee-cups . it‚Äôs their business, not mine . i don‚Äôt know anything about
the coffee-cups, except that we‚Äôve got some that are never used, which
are a perfect dream ! old worcester . you‚Äôre not a connoisseur, are you,
hastings ?‚Äù

i shook my head .

‚Äúyou miss a lot . a really perfect bit of old china‚Äîit‚Äôs pure delight to
handle it, or even to look at it .‚Äù

‚Äúwell, what am i to tell poirot ?‚Äù

‚Äútell him i don‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs talking about . it‚Äôs double dutch to
me .‚Äù

‚Äúall right .‚Äù

i was moving off towards the house again when he suddenly called me
back .

‚Äúi say, what was the end of that message ? say it over again, will you ?‚Äù

‚Äú‚Äòfind the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace .‚Äô are you sure
you don‚Äôt know what it means ?‚Äù i asked him earnestly .

he shook his head .

‚Äúno,‚Äù he said musingly, ‚Äúi don‚Äôt . i‚Äîi wish i did .‚Äù

the boom of the gong sounded from the house, and we went in together .
poirot had been asked by john to remain to lunch, and was already
seated at the table .

by tacit consent, all mention of the tragedy was barred . we conversed
on the war, and other outside topics . but after the cheese and biscuits
had been handed round, and dorcas had left the room, poirot suddenly
leant forward to mrs . cavendish .

‚Äúpardon me, madame, for recalling unpleasant memories, but i have a
little idea‚Äù‚Äîpoirot‚Äôs ‚Äúlittle ideas‚Äù were becoming a perfect
byword‚Äî‚Äúand would like to ask one or two questions .‚Äù

‚Äúof me ? certainly .‚Äù

‚Äúyou are too amiable, madame . what i want to ask is this: the door
leading into mrs . inglethorp‚Äôs room from that of mademoiselle cynthia,
it was bolted, you say ?‚Äù

‚Äúcertainly it was bolted,‚Äù replied mary cavendish, rather surprised . ‚Äúi
said so at the inquest .‚Äù

‚Äúbolted ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes .‚Äù she looked perplexed .

‚Äúi mean,‚Äù explained poirot, ‚Äúyou are sure it was bolted, and not merely
locked ?‚Äù

‚Äúoh, i see what you mean . no, i don‚Äôt know . i said bolted, meaning that
it was fastened, and i could not open it, but i believe all the doors
were found bolted on the inside .‚Äù

‚Äústill, as far as you are concerned, the door might equally well have
been locked ?‚Äù

‚Äúoh, yes .‚Äù

‚Äúyou yourself did not happen to notice, madame, when you entered mrs .
inglethorp‚Äôs room, whether that door was bolted or not ?‚Äù

‚Äúi‚Äîi believe it was .‚Äù

‚Äúbut you did not see it ?‚Äù

‚Äúno . i‚Äînever looked .‚Äù

‚Äúbut _i_ did,‚Äù interrupted lawrence suddenly . ‚Äúi happened to notice
that it _was_ bolted .‚Äù

‚Äúah, that settles it .‚Äù and poirot looked crestfallen .

i could not help rejoicing that, for once, one of his ‚Äúlittle ideas‚Äù
had come to naught .

after lunch poirot begged me to accompany him home . i consented rather
stiffly .

‚Äúyou are annoyed, is it not so ?‚Äù he asked anxiously, as we walked
through the park .

‚Äúnot at all,‚Äù i said coldly .

‚Äúthat is well . that lifts a great load from my mind .‚Äù

this was not quite what i had intended . i had hoped that he would have
observed the stiffness of my manner . still, the fervour of his words
went towards the appeasing of my just displeasure . i thawed .

‚Äúi gave lawrence your message,‚Äù i said .

‚Äúand what did he say ? he was entirely puzzled ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes . i am quite sure he had no idea of what you meant .‚Äù

i had expected poirot to be disappointed; but, to my surprise, he
replied that that was as he had thought, and that he was very glad . my
pride forbade me to ask any questions .

poirot switched off on another tack .

‚Äúmademoiselle cynthia was not at lunch to-day ? how was that ?‚Äù

‚Äúshe is at the hospital again . she resumed work to-day .‚Äù

‚Äúah, she is an industrious little demoiselle . and pretty too . she is
like pictures i have seen in italy . i would rather like to see that
dispensary of hers . do you think she would show it to me ?‚Äù

‚Äúi am sure she would be delighted . it‚Äôs an interesting little place .‚Äù

‚Äúdoes she go there every day ?‚Äù

‚Äúshe has all wednesdays off, and comes back to lunch on saturdays .
those are her only times off .‚Äù

‚Äúi will remember . women are doing great work nowadays, and mademoiselle
cynthia is clever‚Äîoh, yes, she has brains, that little one .‚Äù

‚Äúyes . i believe she has passed quite a stiff exam .‚Äù

‚Äúwithout doubt . after all, it is very responsible work . i suppose they
have very strong poisons there ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes, she showed them to us . they are kept locked up in a little
cupboard . i believe they have to be very careful . they always take out
the key before leaving the room .‚Äù

‚Äúindeed . it is near the window, this cupboard ?‚Äù

‚Äúno, right the other side of the room . why ?‚Äù

poirot shrugged his shoulders .

‚Äúi wondered . that is all . will you come in ?‚Äù

we had reached the cottage .

‚Äúno . i think i‚Äôll be getting back . i shall go round the long way
through the woods .‚Äù

the woods round styles were very beautiful . after the walk across the
open park, it was pleasant to saunter lazily through the cool glades .
there was hardly a breath of wind, the very chirp of the birds was
faint and subdued . i strolled on a little way, and finally flung myself
down at the foot of a grand old beech-tree . my thoughts of mankind were
kindly and charitable . i even forgave poirot for his absurd secrecy . in
fact, i was at peace with the world . then i yawned .

i thought about the crime, and it struck me as being very unreal and
far off .

i yawned again .

probably, i thought, it really never happened . of course, it was all a
bad dream . the truth of the matter was that it was lawrence who had
murdered alfred inglethorp with a croquet mallet . but it was absurd of
john to make such a fuss about it, and to go shouting out: ‚Äúi tell you
i won‚Äôt have it !‚Äù

i woke up with a start .

at once i realized that i was in a very awkward predicament . for, about
twelve feet away from me, john and mary cavendish were standing facing
each other, and they were evidently quarrelling . and, quite as
evidently, they were unaware of my vicinity, for before i could move or
speak john repeated the words which had aroused me from my dream .

‚Äúi tell you, mary, i won‚Äôt have it .‚Äù

mary‚Äôs voice came, cool and liquid:

‚Äúhave _you_ any right to criticize my actions ?‚Äù

‚Äúit will be the talk of the village ! my mother was only buried on
saturday, and here you are gadding about with the fellow .‚Äù

‚Äúoh,‚Äù she shrugged her shoulders, ‚Äúif it is only village gossip that
you mind !‚Äù

‚Äúbut it isn‚Äôt . i‚Äôve had enough of the fellow hanging about . he‚Äôs a
polish jew, anyway .‚Äù

‚Äúa tinge of jewish blood is not a bad thing . it leavens the‚Äù‚Äîshe looked
at him‚Äî‚Äústolid stupidity of the ordinary englishman .‚Äù

fire in her eyes, ice in her voice . i did not wonder that the blood
rose to john‚Äôs face in a crimson tide .

‚Äúmary !‚Äù

‚Äúwell ?‚Äù her tone did not change .

the pleading died out of his voice .

‚Äúam i to understand that you will continue to see bauerstein against my
express wishes ?‚Äù

‚Äúif i choose .‚Äù

‚Äúyou defy me ?‚Äù

‚Äúno, but i deny your right to criticize my actions . have _you_ no
friends of whom i should disapprove ?‚Äù

john fell back a pace . the colour ebbed slowly from his face .

‚Äúwhat do you mean ?‚Äù he said, in an unsteady voice .

‚Äúyou see !‚Äù said mary quietly . ‚Äúyou _do_ see, don‚Äôt you, that _you_ have
no right to dictate to _me_ as to the choice of my friends ?‚Äù

john glanced at her pleadingly, a stricken look on his face .

‚Äúno right ? have i _no_ right, mary ?‚Äù he said unsteadily . he stretched
out his hands . ‚Äúmary‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù

for a moment, i thought she wavered . a softer expression came over her
face, then suddenly she turned almost fiercely away .

‚Äúnone !‚Äù

she was walking away when john sprang after her, and caught her by the
arm .

‚Äúmary‚Äù‚Äîhis voice was very quiet now‚Äî‚Äúare you in love with this fellow
bauerstein ?‚Äù

she hesitated, and suddenly there swept across her face a strange
expression, old as the hills, yet with something eternally young about
it . so might some egyptian sphinx have smiled .

she freed herself quietly from his arm, and spoke over her shoulder .

‚Äúperhaps,‚Äù she said; and then swiftly passed out of the little glade,
leaving john standing there as though he had been turned to stone .

rather ostentatiously, i stepped forward, crackling some dead branches
with my feet as i did so . john turned . luckily, he took it for granted
that i had only just come upon the scene .

‚Äúhullo, hastings . have you seen the little fellow safely back to his
cottage ? quaint little chap ! is he any good, though, really ?‚Äù

‚Äúhe was considered one of the finest detectives of his day .‚Äù

‚Äúoh, well, i suppose there must be something in it, then . what a rotten
world it is, though !‚Äù

‚Äúyou find it so ?‚Äù i asked .

‚Äúgood lord, yes ! there‚Äôs this terrible business to start with . scotland
yard men in and out of the house like a jack-in-the-box ! never know
where they won‚Äôt turn up next . screaming headlines in every paper in
the country‚Äîdamn all journalists, i say ! do you know there was a whole
crowd staring in at the lodge gates this morning . sort of madame
tussaud‚Äôs chamber of horrors business that can be seen for nothing .
pretty thick, isn‚Äôt it ?‚Äù

‚Äúcheer up, john !‚Äù i said soothingly . ‚Äúit can‚Äôt last for ever .‚Äù

‚Äúcan‚Äôt it, though ? it can last long enough for us never to be able to
hold up our heads again .‚Äù

‚Äúno, no, you‚Äôre getting morbid on the subject .‚Äù

‚Äúenough to make a man morbid, to be stalked by beastly journalists and
stared at by gaping moon-faced idiots, wherever he goes ! but there‚Äôs
worse than that .‚Äù

‚Äúwhat ?‚Äù

john lowered his voice:

‚Äúhave you ever thought, hastings‚Äîit‚Äôs a nightmare to me‚Äîwho did it ? i
can‚Äôt help feeling sometimes it must have been an accident .
because‚Äîbecause‚Äîwho could have done it ? now inglethorp‚Äôs out of the
way, there‚Äôs no one else; no one, i mean, except‚Äîone of us .‚Äù

yes, indeed, that was nightmare enough for any man ! one of us ? yes,
surely it must be so, unless‚Äî‚Äî-

a new idea suggested itself to my mind . rapidly, i considered it . the
light increased . poirot‚Äôs mysterious doings, his hints‚Äîthey all fitted
in . fool that i was not to have thought of this possibility before, and
what a relief for us all .

‚Äúno, john,‚Äù i said, ‚Äúit isn‚Äôt one of us . how could it be ?‚Äù

‚Äúi know, but, still, who else is there ?‚Äù

‚Äúcan‚Äôt you guess ?‚Äù

‚Äúno .‚Äù

i looked cautiously round, and lowered my voice .

‚Äúdr . bauerstein !‚Äù i whispered .

‚Äúimpossible !‚Äù

‚Äúnot at all .‚Äù

‚Äúbut what earthly interest could he have in my mother‚Äôs death ?‚Äù

‚Äúthat i don‚Äôt see,‚Äù i confessed, ‚Äúbut i‚Äôll tell you this: poirot thinks
so .‚Äù

‚Äúpoirot ? does he ? how do you know ?‚Äù

i told him of poirot‚Äôs intense excitement on hearing that dr .
bauerstein had been at styles on the fatal night, and added:

‚Äúhe said twice: ‚Äòthat alters everything .‚Äô and i‚Äôve been thinking . you
know inglethorp said he had put down the coffee in the hall ? well, it
was just then that bauerstein arrived . isn‚Äôt it possible that, as
inglethorp brought him through the hall, the doctor dropped something
into the coffee in passing ?‚Äù

‚Äúh‚Äôm,‚Äù said john . ‚Äúit would have been very risky .‚Äù

‚Äúyes, but it was possible .‚Äù

‚Äúand then, how could he know it was her coffee ? no, old fellow, i don‚Äôt
think that will wash .‚Äù

but i had remembered something else .

‚Äúyou‚Äôre quite right . that wasn‚Äôt how it was done . listen .‚Äù and i then
told him of the cocoa sample which poirot had taken to be analysed .

john interrupted just as i had done .

‚Äúbut, look here, bauerstein had had it analysed already ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes, yes, that‚Äôs the point . i didn‚Äôt see it either until now . don‚Äôt
you understand ? bauerstein had it analysed‚Äîthat‚Äôs just it ! if
bauerstein‚Äôs the murderer, nothing could be simpler than for him to
substitute some ordinary cocoa for his sample, and send that to be
tested . and of course they would find no strychnine ! but no one would
dream of suspecting bauerstein, or think of taking another
sample‚Äîexcept poirot,‚Äù i added, with belated recognition .

‚Äúyes, but what about the bitter taste that cocoa won‚Äôt disguise ?‚Äù

‚Äúwell, we‚Äôve only his word for that . and there are other possibilities .
he‚Äôs admittedly one of the world‚Äôs greatest toxicologists‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù

‚Äúone of the world‚Äôs greatest what ? say it again .‚Äù

‚Äúhe knows more about poisons than almost anybody,‚Äù i explained . ‚Äúwell,
my idea is, that perhaps he‚Äôs found some way of making strychnine
tasteless . or it may not have been strychnine at all, but some obscure
drug no one has ever heard of, which produces much the same symptoms .‚Äù

‚Äúh‚Äôm, yes, that might be,‚Äù said john . ‚Äúbut look here, how could he have
got at the cocoa ? that wasn‚Äôt downstairs ?‚Äù

‚Äúno, it wasn‚Äôt,‚Äù i admitted reluctantly .

and then, suddenly, a dreadful possibility flashed through my mind . i
hoped and prayed it would not occur to john also . i glanced sideways at
him . he was frowning perplexedly, and i drew a deep breath of relief,
for the terrible thought that had flashed across my mind was this: that
dr . bauerstein might have had an accomplice .

yet surely it could not be ! surely no woman as beautiful as mary
cavendish could be a murderess . yet beautiful women had been known to
poison .

and suddenly i remembered that first conversation at tea on the day of
my arrival, and the gleam in her eyes as she had said that poison was a
woman‚Äôs weapon . how agitated she had been on that fatal tuesday
evening ! had mrs . inglethorp discovered something between her and
bauerstein, and threatened to tell her husband ? was it to stop that
denunciation that the crime had been committed ?

then i remembered that enigmatical conversation between poirot and
evelyn howard . was this what they had meant ? was this the monstrous
possibility that evelyn had tried not to believe ?

yes, it all fitted in .

no wonder miss howard had suggested ‚Äúhushing it up .‚Äù now i understood
that unfinished sentence of hers: ‚Äúemily herself‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù and in my heart i
agreed with her . would not mrs . inglethorp have preferred to go
unavenged rather than have such terrible dishonour fall upon the name
of cavendish .

‚Äúthere‚Äôs another thing,‚Äù said john suddenly, and the unexpected sound
of his voice made me start guiltily . ‚Äúsomething which makes me doubt if
what you say can be true .‚Äù

‚Äúwhat‚Äôs that ?‚Äù i asked, thankful that he had gone away from the subject
of how the poison could have been introduced into the cocoa .

‚Äúwhy, the fact that bauerstein demanded a post-mortem . he needn‚Äôt have
done so . little wilkins would have been quite content to let it go at
heart disease .‚Äù

‚Äúyes,‚Äù i said doubtfully . ‚Äúbut we don‚Äôt know . perhaps he thought it
safer in the long run . someone might have talked afterwards . then the
home office might have ordered exhumation . the whole thing would have
come out, then, and he would have been in an awkward position, for no
one would have believed that a man of his reputation could have been
deceived into calling it heart disease .‚Äù

‚Äúyes, that‚Äôs possible,‚Äù admitted john . ‚Äústill,‚Äù he added, ‚Äúi‚Äôm blest if
i can see what his motive could have been .‚Äù

i trembled .

‚Äúlook here,‚Äù i said, ‚Äúi may be altogether wrong . and, remember, all
this is in confidence .‚Äù

‚Äúoh, of course‚Äîthat goes without saying .‚Äù

we had walked, as we talked, and now we passed through the little gate
into the garden . voices rose near at hand, for tea was spread out under
the sycamore-tree, as it had been on the day of my arrival .

cynthia was back from the hospital, and i placed my chair beside her,
and told her of poirot‚Äôs wish to visit the dispensary .

‚Äúof course ! i‚Äôd love him to see it . he‚Äôd better come to tea there one
day . i must fix it up with him . he‚Äôs such a dear little man ! but he
_is_ funny . he made me take the brooch out of my tie the other day, and
put it in again, because he said it wasn‚Äôt straight .‚Äù

i laughed .

‚Äúit‚Äôs quite a mania with him .‚Äù

‚Äúyes, isn‚Äôt it ?‚Äù

we were silent for a minute or two, and then, glancing in the direction
of mary cavendish, and dropping her voice, cynthia said:

‚Äúmr . hastings .‚Äù

‚Äúyes ?‚Äù

‚Äúafter tea, i want to talk to you .‚Äù

her glance at mary had set me thinking . i fancied that between these
two there existed very little sympathy . for the first time, it occurred
to me to wonder about the girl‚Äôs future . mrs . inglethorp had made no
provisions of any kind for her, but i imagined that john and mary would
probably insist on her making her home with them‚Äîat any rate until the
end of the war . john, i knew, was very fond of her, and would be sorry
to let her go .

john, who had gone into the house, now reappeared . his good-natured
face wore an unaccustomed frown of anger .

‚Äúconfound those detectives ! i can‚Äôt think what they‚Äôre after ! they‚Äôve
been in every room in the house‚Äîturning things inside out, and upside
down . it really is too bad ! i suppose they took advantage of our all
being out . i shall go for that fellow japp, when i next see him !‚Äù

‚Äúlot of paul prys,‚Äù grunted miss howard .

lawrence opined that they had to make a show of doing something .

mary cavendish said nothing .

after tea, i invited cynthia to come for a walk, and we sauntered off
into the woods together .

‚Äúwell ?‚Äù i inquired, as soon as we were protected from prying eyes by
the leafy screen .

with a sigh, cynthia flung herself down, and tossed off her hat . the
sunlight, piercing through the branches, turned the auburn of her hair
to quivering gold .

‚Äúmr . hastings‚Äîyou are always so kind, and you know such a lot .‚Äù

it struck me at this moment that cynthia was really a very charming
girl ! much more charming than mary, who never said things of that kind .

‚Äúwell ?‚Äù i asked benignantly, as she hesitated .

‚Äúi want to ask your advice . what shall i do ?‚Äù

‚Äúdo ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes . you see, aunt emily always told me i should be provided for . i
suppose she forgot, or didn‚Äôt think she was likely to die‚Äîanyway, i am
_not_ provided for ! and i don‚Äôt know what to do . do you think i ought
to go away from here at once ?‚Äù

‚Äúgood heavens, no ! they don‚Äôt want to part with you, i‚Äôm sure .‚Äù

cynthia hesitated a moment, plucking up the grass with her tiny hands .
then she said: ‚Äúmrs . cavendish does . she hates me .‚Äù

‚Äúhates you ?‚Äù i cried, astonished .

cynthia nodded .

‚Äúyes . i don‚Äôt know why, but she can‚Äôt bear me; and _he_ can‚Äôt, either .‚Äù

‚Äúthere i know you‚Äôre wrong,‚Äù i said warmly . ‚Äúon the contrary, john is
very fond of you .‚Äù

‚Äúoh, yes‚Äî_john_ . i meant lawrence . not, of course, that i care whether
lawrence hates me or not . still, it‚Äôs rather horrid when no one loves
you, isn‚Äôt it ?‚Äù

‚Äúbut they do, cynthia dear,‚Äù i said earnestly . ‚Äúi‚Äôm sure you are
mistaken . look, there is john‚Äîand miss howard‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù

cynthia nodded rather gloomily . ‚Äúyes, john likes me, i think, and of
course evie, for all her gruff ways, wouldn‚Äôt be unkind to a fly . but
lawrence never speaks to me if he can help it, and mary can hardly
bring herself to be civil to me . she wants evie to stay on, is begging
her to, but she doesn‚Äôt want me, and‚Äîand‚Äîi don‚Äôt know what to do .‚Äù
suddenly the poor child burst out crying .

i don‚Äôt know what possessed me . her beauty, perhaps, as she sat there,
with the sunlight glinting down on her head; perhaps the sense of
relief at encountering someone who so obviously could have no
connection with the tragedy; perhaps honest pity for her youth and
loneliness . anyway, i leant forward, and taking her little hand, i said
awkwardly:

‚Äúmarry me, cynthia .‚Äù

unwittingly, i had hit upon a sovereign remedy for her tears . she sat
up at once, drew her hand away, and said, with some asperity:

‚Äúdon‚Äôt be silly !‚Äù

i was a little annoyed .

‚Äúi‚Äôm not being silly . i am asking you to do me the honour of becoming
my wife .‚Äù

to my intense surprise, cynthia burst out laughing, and called me a
‚Äúfunny dear .‚Äù

‚Äúit‚Äôs perfectly sweet of you,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúbut you know you don‚Äôt want
to !‚Äù

‚Äúyes, i do . i‚Äôve got‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù

‚Äúnever mind what you‚Äôve got . you don‚Äôt really want to‚Äîand i don‚Äôt
either .‚Äù

‚Äúwell, of course, that settles it,‚Äù i said stiffly . ‚Äúbut i don‚Äôt see
anything to laugh at . there‚Äôs nothing funny about a proposal .‚Äù

‚Äúno, indeed,‚Äù said cynthia . ‚Äúsomebody might accept you next time .
good-bye, you‚Äôve cheered me up _very_ much .‚Äù

and, with a final uncontrollable burst of merriment, she vanished
through the trees .

thinking over the interview, it struck me as being profoundly
unsatisfactory .

it occurred to me suddenly that i would go down to the village, and
look up bauerstein . somebody ought to be keeping an eye on the fellow .
at the same time, it would be wise to allay any suspicions he might
have as to his being suspected . i remembered how poirot had relied on
my diplomacy . accordingly, i went to the little house with the
‚Äúapartments‚Äù card inserted in the window, where i knew he lodged, and
tapped on the door .

an old woman came and opened it .

‚Äúgood afternoon,‚Äù i said pleasantly . ‚Äúis dr . bauerstein in ?‚Äù

she stared at me .

‚Äúhaven‚Äôt you heard ?‚Äù

‚Äúheard what ?‚Äù

‚Äúabout him .‚Äù

‚Äúwhat about him ?‚Äù

‚Äúhe‚Äôs took .‚Äù

‚Äútook ? dead ?‚Äù

‚Äúno, took by the perlice .‚Äù

‚Äúby the police !‚Äù i gasped . ‚Äúdo you mean they‚Äôve arrested him ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes, that‚Äôs it, and‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù

i waited to hear no more, but tore up the village to find poirot .






chapter x . the arrest

to my extreme annoyance, poirot was not in, and the old belgian who
answered my knock informed me that he believed he had gone to london .

i was dumbfounded . what on earth could poirot be doing in london ! was
it a sudden decision on his part, or had he already made up his mind
when he parted from me a few hours earlier ?

i retraced my steps to styles in some annoyance . with poirot away, i
was uncertain how to act . had he foreseen this arrest ? had he not, in
all probability, been the cause of it ? those questions i could not
resolve . but in the meantime what was i to do ? should i announce the
arrest openly at styles, or not ? though i did not acknowledge it to
myself, the thought of mary cavendish was weighing on me . would it not
be a terrible shock to her ? for the moment, i set aside utterly any
suspicions of her . she could not be implicated‚Äîotherwise i should have
heard some hint of it .

of course, there was no possibility of being able permanently to
conceal dr . bauerstein‚Äôs arrest from her . it would be announced in
every newspaper on the morrow . still, i shrank from blurting it out . if
only poirot had been accessible, i could have asked his advice . what
possessed him to go posting off to london in this unaccountable way ?

in spite of myself, my opinion of his sagacity was immeasurably
heightened . i would never have dreamt of suspecting the doctor, had not
poirot put it into my head . yes, decidedly, the little man was clever .

after some reflecting, i decided to take john into my confidence, and
leave him to make the matter public or not, as he thought fit .

he gave vent to a prodigious whistle, as i imparted the news .

‚Äúgreat scott ! you _were_ right, then . i couldn‚Äôt believe it at the
time .‚Äù

‚Äúno, it is astonishing until you get used to the idea, and see how it
makes everything fit in . now, what are we to do ? of course, it will be
generally known to-morrow .‚Äù

john reflected .

‚Äúnever mind,‚Äù he said at last, ‚Äúwe won‚Äôt say anything at present . there
is no need . as you say, it will be known soon enough .‚Äù

but to my intense surprise, on getting down early the next morning, and
eagerly opening the newspapers, there was not a word about the arrest !
there was a column of mere padding about ‚Äúthe styles poisoning case,‚Äù
but nothing further . it was rather inexplicable, but i supposed that,
for some reason or other, japp wished to keep it out of the papers . it
worried me just a little, for it suggested the possibility that there
might be further arrests to come .

after breakfast, i decided to go down to the village, and see if poirot
had returned yet; but, before i could start, a well-known face blocked
one of the windows, and the well-known voice said:

‚Äú_bonjour, mon ami !_‚Äù

‚Äúpoirot,‚Äù i exclaimed, with relief, and seizing him by both hands, i
dragged him into the room . ‚Äúi was never so glad to see anyone . listen,
i have said nothing to anybody but john . is that right ?‚Äù

‚Äúmy friend,‚Äù replied poirot, ‚Äúi do not know what you are talking
about .‚Äù

‚Äúdr . bauerstein‚Äôs arrest, of course,‚Äù i answered impatiently .

‚Äúis bauerstein arrested, then ?‚Äù

‚Äúdid you not know it ?‚Äù

‚Äúnot the least in the world .‚Äù but, pausing a moment, he added: ‚Äústill,
it does not surprise me . after all, we are only four miles from the
coast .‚Äù

‚Äúthe coast ?‚Äù i asked, puzzled . ‚Äúwhat has that got to do with it ?‚Äù

poirot shrugged his shoulders .

‚Äúsurely, it is obvious !‚Äù

‚Äúnot to me . no doubt i am very dense, but i cannot see what the
proximity of the coast has got to do with the murder of mrs .
inglethorp .‚Äù

‚Äúnothing at all, of course,‚Äù replied poirot, smiling . ‚Äúbut we were
speaking of the arrest of dr . bauerstein .‚Äù

‚Äúwell, he is arrested for the murder of mrs . inglethorp‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù

‚Äúwhat ?‚Äù cried poirot, in apparently lively astonishment . ‚Äúdr .
bauerstein arrested for the murder of mrs . inglethorp ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes .‚Äù

‚Äúimpossible ! that would be too good a farce ! who told you that, my
friend ?‚Äù

‚Äúwell, no one exactly told me,‚Äù i confessed . ‚Äúbut he is arrested .‚Äù

‚Äúoh, yes, very likely . but for espionage, _mon ami_ .‚Äù

‚Äúespionage ?‚Äù i gasped .

‚Äúprecisely .‚Äù

‚Äúnot for poisoning mrs . inglethorp ?‚Äù

‚Äúnot unless our friend japp has taken leave of his senses,‚Äù replied
poirot placidly .

‚Äúbut‚Äîbut i thought you thought so too ?‚Äù

poirot gave me one look, which conveyed a wondering pity, and his full
sense of the utter absurdity of such an idea .

‚Äúdo you mean to say,‚Äù i asked, slowly adapting myself to the new idea,
‚Äúthat dr . bauerstein is a spy ?‚Äù

poirot nodded .

‚Äúhave you never suspected it ?‚Äù

‚Äúit never entered my head .‚Äù

‚Äúit did not strike you as peculiar that a famous london doctor should
bury himself in a little village like this, and should be in the habit
of walking about at all hours of the night, fully dressed ?‚Äù

‚Äúno,‚Äù i confessed, ‚Äúi never thought of such a thing .‚Äù

‚Äúhe is, of course, a german by birth,‚Äù said poirot thoughtfully,
‚Äúthough he has practised so long in this country that nobody thinks of
him as anything but an englishman . he was naturalized about fifteen
years ago . a very clever man‚Äîa jew, of course .‚Äù

‚Äúthe blackguard !‚Äù i cried indignantly .

‚Äúnot at all . he is, on the contrary, a patriot . think what he stands to
lose . i admire the man myself .‚Äù

but i could not look at it in poirot‚Äôs philosophical way .

‚Äúand this is the man with whom mrs . cavendish has been wandering about
all over the country !‚Äù i cried indignantly .

‚Äúyes . i should fancy he had found her very useful,‚Äù remarked poirot .
‚Äúso long as gossip busied itself in coupling their names together, any
other vagaries of the doctor‚Äôs passed unobserved .‚Äù

‚Äúthen you think he never really cared for her ?‚Äù i asked eagerly‚Äîrather
too eagerly, perhaps, under the circumstances .

‚Äúthat, of course, i cannot say, but‚Äîshall i tell you my own private
opinion, hastings ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes .‚Äù

‚Äúwell, it is this: that mrs . cavendish does not care, and never has
cared one little jot about dr . bauerstein !‚Äù

‚Äúdo you really think so ?‚Äù i could not disguise my pleasure .

‚Äúi am quite sure of it . and i will tell you why .‚Äù

‚Äúyes ?‚Äù

‚Äúbecause she cares for someone else, _mon ami_ .‚Äù

‚Äúoh !‚Äù what did he mean ? in spite of myself, an agreeable warmth spread
over me . i am not a vain man where women are concerned, but i
remembered certain evidences, too lightly thought of at the time,
perhaps, but which certainly seemed to indicate‚Äî‚Äî

my pleasing thoughts were interrupted by the sudden entrance of miss
howard . she glanced round hastily to make sure there was no one else in
the room, and quickly produced an old sheet of brown paper . this she
handed to poirot, murmuring as she did so the cryptic words:

‚Äúon top of the wardrobe .‚Äù then she hurriedly left the room .

poirot unfolded the sheet of paper eagerly, and uttered an exclamation
of satisfaction . he spread it out on the table .

‚Äúcome here, hastings . now tell me, what is that initial‚Äîj . or l .?‚Äù

it was a medium sized sheet of paper, rather dusty, as though it had
lain by for some time . but it was the label that was attracting
poirot‚Äôs attention . at the top, it bore the printed stamp of messrs .
parkson‚Äôs, the well-known theatrical costumiers, and it was addressed
to ‚Äú‚Äî(the debatable initial) cavendish, esq ., styles court, styles st .
mary, essex .‚Äù

‚Äúit might be t ., or it might be l .,‚Äù i said, after studying the thing
for a minute or two . ‚Äúit certainly isn‚Äôt a j .‚Äù

‚Äúgood,‚Äù replied poirot, folding up the paper again . ‚Äúi, also, am of
your way of thinking . it is an l ., depend upon it !‚Äù

‚Äúwhere did it come from ?‚Äù i asked curiously . ‚Äúis it important ?‚Äù

‚Äúmoderately so . it confirms a surmise of mine . having deduced its
existence, i set miss howard to search for it, and, as you see, she has
been successful .‚Äù

‚Äúwhat did she mean by ‚Äòon the top of the wardrobe‚Äô ?‚Äù

‚Äúshe meant,‚Äù replied poirot promptly, ‚Äúthat she found it on top of a
wardrobe .‚Äù

‚Äúa funny place for a piece of brown paper,‚Äù i mused .

‚Äúnot at all . the top of a wardrobe is an excellent place for brown
paper and cardboard boxes . i have kept them there myself . neatly
arranged, there is nothing to offend the eye .‚Äù

‚Äúpoirot,‚Äù i asked earnestly, ‚Äúhave you made up your mind about this
crime ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes‚Äîthat is to say, i believe i know how it was committed .‚Äù

‚Äúah !‚Äù

‚Äúunfortunately, i have no proof beyond my surmise, unless‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù with
sudden energy, he caught me by the arm, and whirled me down the hall,
calling out in french in his excitement: ‚Äúmademoiselle dorcas,
mademoiselle dorcas, _un moment, s‚Äôil vous pla√Æt !_‚Äù

dorcas, quite flurried by the noise, came hurrying out of the pantry .

‚Äúmy good dorcas, i have an idea‚Äîa little idea‚Äîif it should prove
justified, what magnificent chance ! tell me, on monday, not tuesday,
dorcas, but monday, the day before the tragedy, did anything go wrong
with mrs . inglethorp‚Äôs bell ?‚Äù

dorcas looked very surprised .

‚Äúyes, sir, now you mention it, it did; though i don‚Äôt know how you came
to hear of it . a mouse, or some such, must have nibbled the wire
through . the man came and put it right on tuesday morning .‚Äù

with a long drawn exclamation of ecstasy, poirot led the way back to
the morning-room .

‚Äúsee you, one should not ask for outside proof‚Äîno, reason should be
enough . but the flesh is weak, it is consolation to find that one is on
the right track . ah, my friend, i am like a giant refreshed . i run ! i
leap !‚Äù

and, in very truth, run and leap he did, gambolling wildly down the
stretch of lawn outside the long window .

‚Äúwhat is your remarkable little friend doing ?‚Äù asked a voice behind me,
and i turned to find mary cavendish at my elbow . she smiled, and so did
i . ‚Äúwhat is it all about ?‚Äù

‚Äúreally, i can‚Äôt tell you . he asked dorcas some question about a bell,
and appeared so delighted with her answer that he is capering about as
you see !‚Äù

mary laughed .

‚Äúhow ridiculous ! he‚Äôs going out of the gate . isn‚Äôt he coming back
to-day ?‚Äù

‚Äúi don‚Äôt know . i‚Äôve given up trying to guess what he‚Äôll do next .‚Äù

‚Äúis he quite mad, mr . hastings ?‚Äù

‚Äúi honestly don‚Äôt know . sometimes, i feel sure he is as mad as a
hatter; and then, just as he is at his maddest, i find there is method
in his madness .‚Äù

‚Äúi see .‚Äù

in spite of her laugh, mary was looking thoughtful this morning . she
seemed grave, almost sad .

it occurred to me that it would be a good opportunity to tackle her on
the subject of cynthia . i began rather tactfully, _i_ thought, but i
had not gone far before she stopped me authoritatively .

‚Äúyou are an excellent advocate, i have no doubt, mr . hastings, but in
this case your talents are quite thrown away . cynthia will run no risk
of encountering any unkindness from me .‚Äù

i began to stammer feebly that i hoped she hadn‚Äôt thought‚Äî‚Äî but again
she stopped me, and her words were so unexpected that they quite drove
cynthia, and her troubles, out of my mind .

‚Äúmr . hastings,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúdo you think i and my husband are happy
together ?‚Äù

i was considerably taken aback, and murmured something about it‚Äôs not
being my business to think anything of the sort .

‚Äúwell,‚Äù she said quietly, ‚Äúwhether it is your business or not, i will
tell you that we are _not_ happy .‚Äù

i said nothing, for i saw that she had not finished .

she began slowly, walking up and down the room, her head a little bent,
and that slim, supple figure of hers swaying gently as she walked . she
stopped suddenly, and looked up at me .

‚Äúyou don‚Äôt know anything about me, do you ?‚Äù she asked . ‚Äúwhere i come
from, who i was before i married john‚Äîanything, in fact ? well, i will
tell you . i will make a father confessor of you . you are kind, i
think‚Äîyes, i am sure you are kind .‚Äù

somehow, i was not quite as elated as i might have been . i remembered
that cynthia had begun her confidences in much the same way . besides, a
father confessor should be elderly, it is not at all the role for a
young man .

‚Äúmy father was english,‚Äù said mrs . cavendish, ‚Äúbut my mother was a
russian .‚Äù

‚Äúah,‚Äù i said, ‚Äúnow i understand‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù

‚Äúunderstand what ?‚Äù

‚Äúa hint of something foreign‚Äîdifferent‚Äîthat there has always been about
you .‚Äù

‚Äúmy mother was very beautiful, i believe . i don‚Äôt know, because i never
saw her . she died when i was quite a little child . i believe there was
some tragedy connected with her death‚Äîshe took an overdose of some
sleeping draught by mistake . however that may be, my father was
broken-hearted . shortly afterwards, he went into the consular service .
everywhere he went, i went with him . when i was twenty-three, i had
been nearly all over the world . it was a splendid life‚Äîi loved it .‚Äù

there was a smile on her face, and her head was thrown back . she seemed
living in the memory of those old glad days .

‚Äúthen my father died . he left me very badly off . i had to go and live
with some old aunts in yorkshire .‚Äù she shuddered . ‚Äúyou will understand
me when i say that it was a deadly life for a girl brought up as i had
been . the narrowness, the deadly monotony of it, almost drove me mad .‚Äù
she paused a minute, and added in a different tone: ‚Äúand then i met
john cavendish .‚Äù

‚Äúyes ?‚Äù

‚Äúyou can imagine that, from my aunts‚Äô point of view, it was a very good
match for me . but i can honestly say it was not this fact which weighed
with me . no, he was simply a way of escape from the insufferable
monotony of my life .‚Äù

i said nothing, and after a moment, she went on:

‚Äúdon‚Äôt misunderstand me . i was quite honest with him . i told him, what
was true, that i liked him very much, that i hoped to come to like him
more, but that i was not in any way what the world calls ‚Äòin love‚Äô with
him . he declared that that satisfied him, and so‚Äîwe were married .‚Äù

she waited a long time, a little frown had gathered on her forehead .
she seemed to be looking back earnestly into those past days .

‚Äúi think‚Äîi am sure‚Äîhe cared for me at first . but i suppose we were not
well matched . almost at once, we drifted apart . he‚Äîit is not a pleasing
thing for my pride, but it is the truth‚Äîtired of me very soon .‚Äù i must
have made some murmur of dissent, for she went on quickly: ‚Äúoh, yes, he
did ! not that it matters now‚Äînow that we‚Äôve come to the parting of the
ways .‚Äù

‚Äúwhat do you mean ?‚Äù

she answered quietly:

‚Äúi mean that i am not going to remain at styles .‚Äù

‚Äúyou and john are not going to live here ?‚Äù

‚Äújohn may live here, but i shall not .‚Äù

‚Äúyou are going to leave him ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes .‚Äù

‚Äúbut why ?‚Äù

she paused a long time, and said at last:

‚Äúperhaps‚Äîbecause i want to be‚Äîfree !‚Äù

and, as she spoke, i had a sudden vision of broad spaces, virgin tracts
of forests, untrodden lands‚Äîand a realization of what freedom would
mean to such a nature as mary cavendish . i seemed to see her for a
moment as she was, a proud wild creature, as untamed by civilization as
some shy bird of the hills . a little cry broke from her lips:

‚Äúyou don‚Äôt know, you don‚Äôt know, how this hateful place has been prison
to me !‚Äù

‚Äúi understand,‚Äù i said, ‚Äúbut‚Äîbut don‚Äôt do anything rash .‚Äù

‚Äúoh, rash !‚Äù her voice mocked at my prudence .

then suddenly i said a thing i could have bitten out my tongue for:

‚Äúyou know that dr . bauerstein has been arrested ?‚Äù

an instant coldness passed like a mask over her face, blotting out all
expression .

‚Äújohn was so kind as to break that to me this morning .‚Äù

‚Äúwell, what do you think ?‚Äù i asked feebly .

‚Äúof what ?‚Äù

‚Äúof the arrest ?‚Äù

‚Äúwhat should i think ? apparently he is a german spy; so the gardener
had told john .‚Äù

her face and voice were absolutely cold and expressionless . did she
care, or did she not ?

she moved away a step or two, and fingered one of the flower vases .

‚Äúthese are quite dead . i must do them again . would you mind
moving‚Äîthank you, mr . hastings .‚Äù and she walked quietly past me out of
the window, with a cool little nod of dismissal .

no, surely she could not care for bauerstein . no woman could act her
part with that icy unconcern .

poirot did not make his appearance the following morning, and there was
no sign of the scotland yard men .

but, at lunch-time, there arrived a new piece of evidence‚Äîor rather
lack of evidence . we had vainly tried to trace the fourth letter, which
mrs . inglethorp had written on the evening preceding her death . our
efforts having been in vain, we had abandoned the matter, hoping that
it might turn up of itself one day . and this is just what did happen,
in the shape of a communication, which arrived by the second post from
a firm of french music publishers, acknowledging mrs . inglethorp‚Äôs
cheque, and regretting they had been unable to trace a certain series
of russian folksongs . so the last hope of solving the mystery, by means
of mrs . inglethorp‚Äôs correspondence on the fatal evening, had to be
abandoned .

just before tea, i strolled down to tell poirot of the new
disappointment, but found, to my annoyance, that he was once more out .

‚Äúgone to london again ?‚Äù

‚Äúoh, no, monsieur, he has but taken the train to tadminster . ‚Äòto see a
young lady‚Äôs dispensary,‚Äô he said .‚Äù

‚Äúsilly ass !‚Äù i ejaculated . ‚Äúi told him wednesday was the one day she
wasn‚Äôt there ! well, tell him to look us up to-morrow morning, will
you ?‚Äù

‚Äúcertainly, monsieur .‚Äù

but, on the following day, no sign of poirot . i was getting angry . he
was really treating us in the most cavalier fashion .

after lunch, lawrence drew me aside, and asked if i was going down to
see him .

‚Äúno, i don‚Äôt think i shall . he can come up here if he wants to see us .‚Äù

‚Äúoh !‚Äù lawrence looked indeterminate . something unusually nervous and
excited in his manner roused my curiosity .

‚Äúwhat is it ?‚Äù i asked . ‚Äúi could go if there‚Äôs anything special .‚Äù

‚Äúit‚Äôs nothing much, but‚Äîwell, if you are going, will you tell him‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù he
dropped his voice to a whisper‚Äî‚Äúi think i‚Äôve found the extra
coffee-cup !‚Äù

i had almost forgotten that enigmatical message of poirot‚Äôs, but now my
curiosity was aroused afresh .

lawrence would say no more, so i decided that i would descend from my
high horse, and once more seek out poirot at leastways cottage .

this time i was received with a smile . monsieur poirot was within .
would i mount ? i mounted accordingly .

poirot was sitting by the table, his head buried in his hands . he
sprang up at my entrance .

‚Äúwhat is it ?‚Äù i asked solicitously . ‚Äúyou are not ill, i trust ?‚Äù

‚Äúno, no, not ill . but i decide an affair of great moment .‚Äù

‚Äúwhether to catch the criminal or not ?‚Äù i asked facetiously .

but, to my great surprise, poirot nodded gravely .

‚Äú‚Äòto speak or not to speak,‚Äô as your so great shakespeare says, ‚Äòthat
is the question .‚Äô‚Äù

i did not trouble to correct the quotation .

‚Äúyou are not serious, poirot ?‚Äù

‚Äúi am of the most serious . for the most serious of all things hangs in
the balance .‚Äù

‚Äúand that is ?‚Äù

‚Äúa woman‚Äôs happiness, _mon ami_,‚Äù he said gravely .

i did not quite know what to say .

‚Äúthe moment has come,‚Äù said poirot thoughtfully, ‚Äúand i do not know
what to do . for, see you, it is a big stake for which i play . no one
but i, hercule poirot, would attempt it !‚Äù and he tapped himself proudly
on the breast .

after pausing a few minutes respectfully, so as not to spoil his
effect, i gave him lawrence‚Äôs message .

‚Äúaha !‚Äù he cried . ‚Äúso he has found the extra coffee-cup . that is good .
he has more intelligence than would appear, this long-faced monsieur
lawrence of yours !‚Äù

i did not myself think very highly of lawrence‚Äôs intelligence; but i
forebore to contradict poirot, and gently took him to task for
forgetting my instructions as to which were cynthia‚Äôs days off .

‚Äúit is true . i have the head of a sieve . however, the other young lady
was most kind . she was sorry for my disappointment, and showed me
everything in the kindest way .‚Äù

‚Äúoh, well, that‚Äôs all right, then, and you must go to tea with cynthia
another day .‚Äù

i told him about the letter .

‚Äúi am sorry for that,‚Äù he said . ‚Äúi always had hopes of that letter . but
no, it was not to be . this affair must all be unravelled from within .‚Äù
he tapped his forehead . ‚Äúthese little grey cells . it is ‚Äòup to them‚Äô‚Äîas
you say over here .‚Äù then, suddenly, he asked: ‚Äúare you a judge of
finger-marks, my friend ?‚Äù

‚Äúno,‚Äù i said, rather surprised, ‚Äúi know that there are no two
finger-marks alike, but that‚Äôs as far as my science goes .‚Äù

‚Äúexactly .‚Äù

he unlocked a little drawer, and took out some photographs which he
laid on the table .

‚Äúi have numbered them, 1, 2, 3 . will you describe them to me ?‚Äù

i studied the proofs attentively .

‚Äúall greatly magnified, i see . no . 1, i should say, are a man‚Äôs
finger-prints; thumb and first finger . no . 2 are a lady‚Äôs; they are
much smaller, and quite different in every way . no . 3‚Äù‚Äîi paused for
some time‚Äî‚Äúthere seem to be a lot of confused finger-marks, but here,
very distinctly, are no . 1‚Äôs .‚Äù

‚Äúoverlapping the others ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes .‚Äù

‚Äúyou recognize them beyond fail ?‚Äù

‚Äúoh, yes; they are identical .‚Äù

poirot nodded, and gently taking the photographs from me locked them up
again .

‚Äúi suppose,‚Äù i said, ‚Äúthat as usual, you are not going to explain ?‚Äù

‚Äúon the contrary . no . 1 were the finger-prints of monsieur lawrence .
no . 2 were those of mademoiselle cynthia . they are not important . i
merely obtained them for comparison . no . 3 is a little more
complicated .‚Äù

‚Äúyes ?‚Äù

‚Äúit is, as you see, highly magnified . you may have noticed a sort of
blur extending all across the picture . i will not describe to you the
special apparatus, dusting powder, etc ., which i used . it is a
well-known process to the police, and by means of it you can obtain a
photograph of the finger-prints of any object in a very short space of
time . well, my friend, you have seen the finger-marks‚Äîit remains to
tell you the particular object on which they had been left .‚Äù

‚Äúgo on‚Äîi am really excited .‚Äù

‚Äú_eh bien !_ photo no . 3 represents the highly magnified surface of a
tiny bottle in the top poison cupboard of the dispensary in the red
cross hospital at tadminster‚Äîwhich sounds like the house that jack
built !‚Äù

‚Äúgood heavens !‚Äù i exclaimed . ‚Äúbut what were lawrence cavendish‚Äôs
finger-marks doing on it ? he never went near the poison cupboard the
day we were there !‚Äù

‚Äúoh, yes, he did !‚Äù

‚Äúimpossible ! we were all together the whole time .‚Äù

poirot shook his head .

‚Äúno, my friend, there was a moment when you were not all together .
there was a moment when you could not have been all together, or it
would not have been necessary to call to monsieur lawrence to come and
join you on the balcony .‚Äù

‚Äúi‚Äôd forgotten that,‚Äù i admitted . ‚Äúbut it was only for a moment .‚Äù

‚Äúlong enough .‚Äù

‚Äúlong enough for what ?‚Äù

poirot‚Äôs smile became rather enigmatical .

‚Äúlong enough for a gentleman who had once studied medicine to gratify a
very natural interest and curiosity .‚Äù

our eyes met . poirot‚Äôs were pleasantly vague . he got up and hummed a
little tune . i watched him suspiciously .

‚Äúpoirot,‚Äù i said, ‚Äúwhat was in this particular little bottle ?‚Äù

poirot looked out of the window .

‚Äúhydro-chloride of strychnine,‚Äù he said, over his shoulder, continuing
to hum .

‚Äúgood heavens !‚Äù i said it quite quietly . i was not surprised . i had
expected that answer .

‚Äúthey use the pure hydro-chloride of strychnine very little‚Äîonly
occasionally for pills . it is the official solution, liq . strychnine
hydro-clor . that is used in most medicines . that is why the
finger-marks have remained undisturbed since then .‚Äù

‚Äúhow did you manage to take this photograph ?‚Äù

‚Äúi dropped my hat from the balcony,‚Äù explained poirot simply . ‚Äúvisitors
were not permitted below at that hour, so, in spite of my many
apologies, mademoiselle cynthia‚Äôs colleague had to go down and fetch it
for me .‚Äù

‚Äúthen you knew what you were going to find ?‚Äù

‚Äúno, not at all . i merely realized that it was possible, from your
story, for monsieur lawrence to go to the poison cupboard . the
possibility had to be confirmed, or eliminated .‚Äù

‚Äúpoirot,‚Äù i said, ‚Äúyour gaiety does not deceive me . this is a very
important discovery .‚Äù

‚Äúi do not know,‚Äù said poirot . ‚Äúbut one thing does strike me . no doubt
it has struck you too .‚Äù

‚Äúwhat is that ?‚Äù

‚Äúwhy, that there is altogether too much strychnine about this case .
this is the third time we run up against it . there was strychnine in
mrs . inglethorp‚Äôs tonic . there is the strychnine sold across the
counter at styles st . mary by mace . now we have more strychnine,
handled by one of the household . it is confusing; and, as you know, i
do not like confusion .‚Äù

before i could reply, one of the other belgians opened the door and
stuck his head in .

‚Äúthere is a lady below, asking for mr hastings .‚Äù

‚Äúa lady ?‚Äù

i jumped up . poirot followed me down the narrow stairs . mary cavendish
was standing in the doorway .

‚Äúi have been visiting an old woman in the village,‚Äù she explained, ‚Äúand
as lawrence told me you were with monsieur poirot i thought i would
call for you .‚Äù

‚Äúalas, madame,‚Äù said poirot, ‚Äúi thought you had come to honour me with
a visit !‚Äù

‚Äúi will some day, if you ask me,‚Äù she promised him, smiling .

‚Äúthat is well . if you should need a father confessor, madame‚Äù‚Äîshe
started ever so slightly‚Äî‚Äúremember, papa poirot is always at your
service .‚Äù

she stared at him for a few minutes, as though seeking to read some
deeper meaning into his words . then she turned abruptly away .

‚Äúcome, will you not walk back with us too, monsieur poirot ?‚Äù

‚Äúenchanted, madame .‚Äù

all the way to styles, mary talked fast and feverishly . it struck me
that in some way she was nervous of poirot‚Äôs eyes .

the weather had broken, and the sharp wind was almost autumnal in its
shrewishness . mary shivered a little, and buttoned her black sports
coat closer . the wind through the trees made a mournful noise, like
some great giant sighing .

we walked up to the great door of styles, and at once the knowledge
came to us that something was wrong .

dorcas came running out to meet us . she was crying and wringing her
hands . i was aware of other servants huddled together in the
background, all eyes and ears .

‚Äúoh, m‚Äôam ! oh, m‚Äôam ! i don‚Äôt know how to tell you‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù

‚Äúwhat is it, dorcas ?‚Äù i asked impatiently . ‚Äútell us at once .‚Äù

‚Äúit‚Äôs those wicked detectives . they‚Äôve arrested him‚Äîthey‚Äôve arrested
mr . cavendish !‚Äù

‚Äúarrested lawrence ?‚Äù i gasped .

i saw a strange look come into dorcas‚Äôs eyes .

‚Äúno, sir . not mr . lawrence‚Äîmr . john .‚Äù

behind me, with a wild cry, mary cavendish fell heavily against me, and
as i turned to catch her i met the quiet triumph in poirot‚Äôs eyes .






chapter xi . the case for the prosecution

the trial of john cavendish for the murder of his stepmother took place
two months later .

of the intervening weeks i will say little, but my admiration and
sympathy went out unfeignedly to mary cavendish . she ranged herself
passionately on her husband‚Äôs side, scorning the mere idea of his
guilt, and fought for him tooth and nail .

i expressed my admiration to poirot, and he nodded thoughtfully .

‚Äúyes, she is of those women who show at their best in adversity . it
brings out all that is sweetest and truest in them . her pride and her
jealousy have‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù

‚Äújealousy ?‚Äù i queried .

‚Äúyes . have you not realized that she is an unusually jealous woman ? as
i was saying, her pride and jealousy have been laid aside . she thinks
of nothing but her husband, and the terrible fate that is hanging over
him .‚Äù

he spoke very feelingly, and i looked at him earnestly, remembering
that last afternoon, when he had been deliberating whether or not to
speak . with his tenderness for ‚Äúa woman‚Äôs happiness,‚Äù i felt glad that
the decision had been taken out of his hands .

‚Äúeven now,‚Äù i said, ‚Äúi can hardly believe it . you see, up to the very
last minute, i thought it was lawrence !‚Äù

poirot grinned .

‚Äúi know you did .‚Äù

‚Äúbut john ! my old friend john !‚Äù

‚Äúevery murderer is probably somebody‚Äôs old friend,‚Äù observed poirot
philosophically . ‚Äúyou cannot mix up sentiment and reason .‚Äù

‚Äúi must say i think you might have given me a hint .‚Äù

‚Äúperhaps, _mon ami_, i did not do so, just because he _was_ your old
friend .‚Äù

i was rather disconcerted by this, remembering how i had busily passed
on to john what i believed to be poirot‚Äôs views concerning bauerstein .
he, by the way, had been acquitted of the charge brought against him .
nevertheless, although he had been too clever for them this time, and
the charge of espionage could not be brought home to him, his wings
were pretty well clipped for the future .

i asked poirot whether he thought john would be condemned . to my
intense surprise, he replied that, on the contrary, he was extremely
likely to be acquitted .

‚Äúbut, poirot‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù i protested .

‚Äúoh, my friend, have i not said to you all along that i have no proofs .
it is one thing to know that a man is guilty, it is quite another
matter to prove him so . and, in this case, there is terribly little
evidence . that is the whole trouble . i, hercule poirot, know, but i
lack the last link in my chain . and unless i can find that missing
link‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù he shook his head gravely .

‚Äúwhen did you first suspect john cavendish ?‚Äù i asked, after a minute or
two .

‚Äúdid you not suspect him at all ?‚Äù

‚Äúno, indeed .‚Äù

‚Äúnot after that fragment of conversation you overheard between mrs .
cavendish and her mother-in-law, and her subsequent lack of frankness
at the inquest ?‚Äù

‚Äúno .‚Äù

‚Äúdid you not put two and two together, and reflect that if it was not
alfred inglethorp who was quarrelling with his wife‚Äîand you remember,
he strenuously denied it at the inquest‚Äîit must be either lawrence or
john . now, if it was lawrence, mary cavendish‚Äôs conduct was just as
inexplicable . but if, on the other hand, it was john, the whole thing
was explained quite naturally .‚Äù

‚Äúso,‚Äù i cried, a light breaking in upon me, ‚Äúit was john who quarrelled
with his mother that afternoon ?‚Äù

‚Äúexactly .‚Äù

‚Äúand you have known this all along ?‚Äù

‚Äúcertainly . mrs . cavendish‚Äôs behaviour could only be explained that
way .‚Äù

‚Äúand yet you say he may be acquitted ?‚Äù

poirot shrugged his shoulders .

‚Äúcertainly i do . at the police court proceedings, we shall hear the
case for the prosecution, but in all probability his solicitors will
advise him to reserve his defence . that will be sprung upon us at the
trial . and‚Äîah, by the way, i have a word of caution to give you, my
friend . i must not appear in the case .‚Äù

‚Äúwhat ?‚Äù

‚Äúno . officially, i have nothing to do with it . until i have found that
last link in my chain, i must remain behind the scenes . mrs . cavendish
must think i am working for her husband, not against him .‚Äù

‚Äúi say, that‚Äôs playing it a bit low down,‚Äù i protested .

‚Äúnot at all . we have to deal with a most clever and unscrupulous man,
and we must use any means in our power‚Äîotherwise he will slip through
our fingers . that is why i have been careful to remain in the
background . all the discoveries have been made by japp, and japp will
take all the credit . if i am called upon to give evidence at all‚Äù‚Äîhe
smiled broadly‚Äî‚Äúit will probably be as a witness for the defence .‚Äù

i could hardly believe my ears .

‚Äúit is quite _en r√®gle_,‚Äù continued poirot . ‚Äústrangely enough, i can
give evidence that will demolish one contention of the prosecution .‚Äù

‚Äúwhich one ?‚Äù

‚Äúthe one that relates to the destruction of the will . john cavendish
did not destroy that will .‚Äù

poirot was a true prophet . i will not go into the details of the police
court proceedings, as it involves many tiresome repetitions . i will
merely state baldly that john cavendish reserved his defence, and was
duly committed for trial .

september found us all in london . mary took a house in kensington,
poirot being included in the family party .

i myself had been given a job at the war office, so was able to see
them continually .

as the weeks went by, the state of poirot‚Äôs nerves grew worse and
worse . that ‚Äúlast link‚Äù he talked about was still lacking . privately, i
hoped it might remain so, for what happiness could there be for mary,
if john were not acquitted ?

on september 15th john cavendish appeared in the dock at the old
bailey, charged with ‚Äúthe wilful murder of emily agnes inglethorp,‚Äù and
pleaded ‚Äúnot guilty .‚Äù

sir ernest heavywether, the famous k .c ., had been engaged to defend
him .

mr . philips, k .c ., opened the case for the crown .

the murder, he said, was a most premeditated and cold-blooded one . it
was neither more nor less than the deliberate poisoning of a fond and
trusting woman by the stepson to whom she had been more than a mother .
ever since his boyhood, she had supported him . he and his wife had
lived at styles court in every luxury, surrounded by her care and
attention . she had been their kind and generous benefactress .

he proposed to call witnesses to show how the prisoner, a profligate
and spendthrift, had been at the end of his financial tether, and had
also been carrying on an intrigue with a certain mrs . raikes, a
neighbouring farmer‚Äôs wife . this having come to his stepmother‚Äôs ears,
she taxed him with it on the afternoon before her death, and a quarrel
ensued, part of which was overheard . on the previous day, the prisoner
had purchased strychnine at the village chemist‚Äôs shop, wearing a
disguise by means of which he hoped to throw the onus of the crime upon
another man‚Äîto wit, mrs . inglethorp‚Äôs husband, of whom he had been
bitterly jealous . luckily for mr . inglethorp, he had been able to
produce an unimpeachable alibi .

on the afternoon of july 17th, continued counsel, immediately after the
quarrel with her son, mrs . inglethorp made a new will . this will was
found destroyed in the grate of her bedroom the following morning, but
evidence had come to light which showed that it had been drawn up in
favour of her husband . deceased had already made a will in his favour
before her marriage, but‚Äîand mr . philips wagged an expressive
forefinger‚Äîthe prisoner was not aware of that . what had induced the
deceased to make a fresh will, with the old one still extant, he could
not say . she was an old lady, and might possibly have forgotten the
former one; or‚Äîthis seemed to him more likely‚Äîshe may have had an idea
that it was revoked by her marriage, as there had been some
conversation on the subject . ladies were not always very well versed in
legal knowledge . she had, about a year before, executed a will in
favour of the prisoner . he would call evidence to show that it was the
prisoner who ultimately handed his stepmother her coffee on the fatal
night . later in the evening, he had sought admission to her room, on
which occasion, no doubt, he found an opportunity of destroying the
will which, as far as he knew, would render the one in his favour
valid .

the prisoner had been arrested in consequence of the discovery, in his
room, by detective inspector japp‚Äîa most brilliant officer‚Äîof the
identical phial of strychnine which had been sold at the village
chemist‚Äôs to the supposed mr . inglethorp on the day before the murder .
it would be for the jury to decide whether or not these damning facts
constituted an overwhelming proof of the prisoner‚Äôs guilt .

and, subtly implying that a jury which did not so decide, was quite
unthinkable, mr . philips sat down and wiped his forehead .

the first witnesses for the prosecution were mostly those who had been
called at the inquest, the medical evidence being again taken first .

sir ernest heavywether, who was famous all over england for the
unscrupulous manner in which he bullied witnesses, only asked two
questions .

‚Äúi take it, dr . bauerstein, that strychnine, as a drug, acts quickly ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes .‚Äù

‚Äúand that you are unable to account for the delay in this case ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes .‚Äù

‚Äúthank you .‚Äù

mr . mace identified the phial handed him by counsel as that sold by him
to ‚Äúmr . inglethorp .‚Äù pressed, he admitted that he only knew mr .
inglethorp by sight . he had never spoken to him . the witness was not
cross-examined .

alfred inglethorp was called, and denied having purchased the poison .
he also denied having quarrelled with his wife . various witnesses
testified to the accuracy of these statements .

the gardeners‚Äô evidence, as to the witnessing of the will was taken,
and then dorcas was called .

dorcas, faithful to her ‚Äúyoung gentlemen,‚Äù denied strenuously that it
could have been john‚Äôs voice she heard, and resolutely declared, in the
teeth of everything, that it was mr . inglethorp who had been in the
boudoir with her mistress . a rather wistful smile passed across the
face of the prisoner in the dock . he knew only too well how useless her
gallant defiance was, since it was not the object of the defence to
deny this point . mrs . cavendish, of course, could not be called upon to
give evidence against her husband .

after various questions on other matters, mr . philips asked:

‚Äúin the month of june last, do you remember a parcel arriving for mr .
lawrence cavendish from parkson‚Äôs ?‚Äù

dorcas shook her head .

‚Äúi don‚Äôt remember, sir . it may have done, but mr . lawrence was away
from home part of june .‚Äù

‚Äúin the event of a parcel arriving for him whilst he was away, what
would be done with it ?‚Äù

‚Äúit would either be put in his room or sent on after him .‚Äù

‚Äúby you ?‚Äù

‚Äúno, sir, i should leave it on the hall table . it would be miss howard
who would attend to anything like that .‚Äù

evelyn howard was called and, after being examined on other points, was
questioned as to the parcel .

‚Äúdon‚Äôt remember . lots of parcels come . can‚Äôt remember one special one .‚Äù

‚Äúyou do not know if it was sent after mr . lawrence cavendish to wales,
or whether it was put in his room ?‚Äù

‚Äúdon‚Äôt think it was sent after him . should have remembered it if it
was .‚Äù

‚Äúsupposing a parcel arrived addressed to mr . lawrence cavendish, and
afterwards it disappeared, should you remark its absence ?‚Äù

‚Äúno, don‚Äôt think so . i should think someone had taken charge of it .‚Äù

‚Äúi believe, miss howard, that it was you who found this sheet of brown
paper ?‚Äù he held up the same dusty piece which poirot and i had examined
in the morning-room at styles .

‚Äúyes, i did .‚Äù

‚Äúhow did you come to look for it ?‚Äù

‚Äúthe belgian detective who was employed on the case asked me to search
for it .‚Äù

‚Äúwhere did you eventually discover it ?‚Äù

‚Äúon the top of‚Äîof‚Äîa wardrobe .‚Äù

‚Äúon top of the prisoner‚Äôs wardrobe ?‚Äù

‚Äúi‚Äîi believe so .‚Äù

‚Äúdid you not find it yourself ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes .‚Äù

‚Äúthen you must know where you found it ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes, it was on the prisoner‚Äôs wardrobe .‚Äù

‚Äúthat is better .‚Äù

an assistant from parkson‚Äôs, theatrical costumiers, testified that on
june 29th, they had supplied a black beard to mr . l . cavendish, as
requested . it was ordered by letter, and a postal order was enclosed .
no, they had not kept the letter . all transactions were entered in
their books . they had sent the beard, as directed, to ‚Äúl . cavendish,
esq ., styles court .‚Äù

sir ernest heavywether rose ponderously .

‚Äúwhere was the letter written from ?‚Äù

‚Äúfrom styles court .‚Äù

‚Äúthe same address to which you sent the parcel ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes .‚Äù

‚Äúand the letter came from there ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes .‚Äù

like a beast of prey, heavywether fell upon him:

‚Äúhow do you know ?‚Äù

‚Äúi‚Äîi don‚Äôt understand .‚Äù

‚Äúhow do you know that letter came from styles ? did you notice the
postmark ?‚Äù

‚Äúno‚Äîbut‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù

‚Äúah, you did _not_ notice the postmark ! and yet you affirm so
confidently that it came from styles . it might, in fact, have been any
postmark ?‚Äù

‚Äúy‚Äîes .‚Äù

‚Äúin fact, the letter, though written on stamped notepaper, might have
been posted from anywhere ? from wales, for instance ?‚Äù

the witness admitted that such might be the case, and sir ernest
signified that he was satisfied .

elizabeth wells, second housemaid at styles, stated that after she had
gone to bed she remembered that she had bolted the front door, instead
of leaving it on the latch as mr . inglethorp had requested . she had
accordingly gone downstairs again to rectify her error . hearing a
slight noise in the west wing, she had peeped along the passage, and
had seen mr . john cavendish knocking at mrs . inglethorp‚Äôs door .

sir ernest heavywether made short work of her, and under his unmerciful
bullying she contradicted herself hopelessly, and sir ernest sat down
again with a satisfied smile on his face .

with the evidence of annie, as to the candle grease on the floor, and
as to seeing the prisoner take the coffee into the boudoir, the
proceedings were adjourned until the following day .

as we went home, mary cavendish spoke bitterly against the prosecuting
counsel .

‚Äúthat hateful man ! what a net he has drawn around my poor john ! how he
twisted every little fact until he made it seem what it wasn‚Äôt !‚Äù

‚Äúwell,‚Äù i said consolingly, ‚Äúit will be the other way about to-morrow .‚Äù

‚Äúyes,‚Äù she said meditatively; then suddenly dropped her voice . ‚Äúmr .
hastings, you do not think‚Äîsurely it could not have been lawrence‚Äîoh,
no, that could not be !‚Äù

but i myself was puzzled, and as soon as i was alone with poirot i
asked him what he thought sir ernest was driving at .

‚Äúah !‚Äù said poirot appreciatively . ‚Äúhe is a clever man, that sir
ernest .‚Äù

‚Äúdo you think he believes lawrence guilty ?‚Äù

‚Äúi do not think he believes or cares anything ! no, what he is trying
for is to create such confusion in the minds of the jury that they are
divided in their opinion as to which brother did it . he is endeavouring
to make out that there is quite as much evidence against lawrence as
against john‚Äîand i am not at all sure that he will not succeed .‚Äù

detective-inspector japp was the first witness called when the trial
was reopened, and gave his evidence succinctly and briefly . after
relating the earlier events, he proceeded:

‚Äúacting on information received, superintendent summerhaye and myself
searched the prisoner‚Äôs room, during his temporary absence from the
house . in his chest of drawers, hidden beneath some underclothing, we
found: first, a pair of gold-rimmed pince-nez similar to those worn by
mr . inglethorp‚Äù‚Äîthese were exhibited‚Äî‚Äúsecondly, this phial .‚Äù

the phial was that already recognized by the chemist‚Äôs assistant, a
tiny bottle of blue glass, containing a few grains of a white
crystalline powder, and labelled: ‚Äústrychnine hydro-chloride . poison .‚Äù

a fresh piece of evidence discovered by the detectives since the police
court proceedings was a long, almost new piece of blotting-paper . it
had been found in mrs . inglethorp‚Äôs cheque book, and on being reversed
at a mirror, showed clearly the words: ‚Äú .  .  . erything of which i die
possessed i leave to my beloved husband alfred ing ...‚Äù this placed
beyond question the fact that the destroyed will had been in favour of
the deceased lady‚Äôs husband . japp then produced the charred fragment of
paper recovered from the grate, and this, with the discovery of the
beard in the attic, completed his evidence .

but sir ernest‚Äôs cross-examination was yet to come .

‚Äúwhat day was it when you searched the prisoner‚Äôs room ?‚Äù

‚Äútuesday, the 24th of july .‚Äù

‚Äúexactly a week after the tragedy ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes .‚Äù

‚Äúyou found these two objects, you say, in the chest of drawers . was the
drawer unlocked ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes .‚Äù

‚Äúdoes it not strike you as unlikely that a man who had committed a
crime should keep the evidence of it in an unlocked drawer for anyone
to find ?‚Äù

‚Äúhe might have stowed them there in a hurry .‚Äù

‚Äúbut you have just said it was a whole week since the crime . he would
have had ample time to remove them and destroy them .‚Äù

‚Äúperhaps .‚Äù

‚Äúthere is no perhaps about it . would he, or would he not have had
plenty of time to remove and destroy them ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes .‚Äù

‚Äúwas the pile of underclothes under which the things were hidden heavy
or light ?‚Äù

‚Äúheavyish .‚Äù

‚Äúin other words, it was winter underclothing . obviously, the prisoner
would not be likely to go to that drawer ?‚Äù

‚Äúperhaps not .‚Äù

‚Äúkindly answer my question . would the prisoner, in the hottest week of
a hot summer, be likely to go to a drawer containing winter
underclothing . yes, or no ?‚Äù

‚Äúno .‚Äù

‚Äúin that case, is it not possible that the articles in question might
have been put there by a third person, and that the prisoner was quite
unaware of their presence ?‚Äù

‚Äúi should not think it likely .‚Äù

‚Äúbut it is possible ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes .‚Äù

‚Äúthat is all .‚Äù

more evidence followed . evidence as to the financial difficulties in
which the prisoner had found himself at the end of july . evidence as to
his intrigue with mrs . raikes‚Äîpoor mary, that must have been bitter
hearing for a woman of her pride . evelyn howard had been right in her
facts, though her animosity against alfred inglethorp had caused her to
jump to the conclusion that he was the person concerned .

lawrence cavendish was then put into the box . in a low voice, in answer
to mr . philips‚Äô questions, he denied having ordered anything from
parkson‚Äôs in june . in fact, on june 29th, he had been staying away, in
wales .

instantly, sir ernest‚Äôs chin was shooting pugnaciously forward .

‚Äúyou deny having ordered a black beard from parkson‚Äôs on june 29th ?‚Äù

‚Äúi do .‚Äù

‚Äúah ! in the event of anything happening to your brother, who will
inherit styles court ?‚Äù

the brutality of the question called a flush to lawrence‚Äôs pale face .
the judge gave vent to a faint murmur of disapprobation, and the
prisoner in the dock leant forward angrily .

heavywether cared nothing for his client‚Äôs anger .

‚Äúanswer my question, if you please .‚Äù

‚Äúi suppose,‚Äù said lawrence quietly, ‚Äúthat i should .‚Äù

‚Äúwhat do you mean by you ‚Äòsuppose‚Äô ? your brother has no children . you
_would_ inherit it, wouldn‚Äôt you ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes .‚Äù

‚Äúah, that‚Äôs better,‚Äù said heavywether, with ferocious geniality . ‚Äúand
you‚Äôd inherit a good slice of money too, wouldn‚Äôt you ?‚Äù

‚Äúreally, sir ernest,‚Äù protested the judge, ‚Äúthese questions are not
relevant .‚Äù

sir ernest bowed, and having shot his arrow proceeded .

‚Äúon tuesday, the 17th july, you went, i believe, with another guest, to
visit the dispensary at the red cross hospital in tadminster ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes .‚Äù

‚Äúdid you‚Äîwhile you happened to be alone for a few seconds‚Äîunlock the
poison cupboard, and examine some of the bottles ?‚Äù

‚Äúi‚Äîi‚Äîmay have done so .‚Äù

‚Äúi put it to you that you did do so ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes .‚Äù

sir ernest fairly shot the next question at him .

‚Äúdid you examine one bottle in particular ?‚Äù

‚Äúno, i do not think so .‚Äù

‚Äúbe careful, mr . cavendish . i am referring to a little bottle of
hydro-chloride of strychnine .‚Äù

lawrence was turning a sickly greenish colour .

‚Äún‚Äîo‚Äîi am sure i didn‚Äôt .‚Äù

‚Äúthen how do you account for the fact that you left the unmistakable
impress of your finger-prints on it ?‚Äù

the bullying manner was highly efficacious with a nervous disposition .

‚Äúi‚Äîi suppose i must have taken up the bottle .‚Äù

‚Äúi suppose so too ! did you abstract any of the contents of the bottle ?‚Äù

‚Äúcertainly not .‚Äù

‚Äúthen why did you take it up ?‚Äù

‚Äúi once studied to be a doctor . such things naturally interest me .‚Äù

‚Äúah ! so poisons ‚Äònaturally interest‚Äô you, do they ? still, you waited to
be alone before gratifying that ‚Äòinterest‚Äô of yours ?‚Äù

‚Äúthat was pure chance . if the others had been there, i should have done
just the same .‚Äù

‚Äústill, as it happens, the others were not there ?‚Äù

‚Äúno, but‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù

‚Äúin fact, during the whole afternoon, you were only alone for a couple
of minutes, and it happened‚Äîi say, it happened‚Äîto be during those two
minutes that you displayed your ‚Äònatural interest‚Äô in hydro-chloride of
strychnine ?‚Äù

lawrence stammered pitiably .

‚Äúi‚Äîi‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù

with a satisfied and expressive countenance, sir ernest observed:

‚Äúi have nothing more to ask you, mr . cavendish .‚Äù

this bit of cross-examination had caused great excitement in court . the
heads of the many fashionably attired women present were busily laid
together, and their whispers became so loud that the judge angrily
threatened to have the court cleared if there was not immediate
silence .

there was little more evidence . the hand-writing experts were called
upon for their opinion of the signature of ‚Äúalfred inglethorp‚Äù in the
chemist‚Äôs poison register . they all declared unanimously that it was
certainly not his hand-writing, and gave it as their view that it might
be that of the prisoner disguised . cross-examined, they admitted that
it might be the prisoner‚Äôs hand-writing cleverly counterfeited .

sir ernest heavywether‚Äôs speech in opening the case for the defence was
not a long one, but it was backed by the full force of his emphatic
manner . never, he said, in the course of his long experience, had he
known a charge of murder rest on slighter evidence . not only was it
entirely circumstantial, but the greater part of it was practically
unproved . let them take the testimony they had heard and sift it
impartially . the strychnine had been found in a drawer in the
prisoner‚Äôs room . that drawer was an unlocked one, as he had pointed
out, and he submitted that there was no evidence to prove that it was
the prisoner who had concealed the poison there . it was, in fact, a
wicked and malicious attempt on the part of some third person to fix
the crime on the prisoner . the prosecution had been unable to produce a
shred of evidence in support of their contention that it was the
prisoner who ordered the black beard from parkson‚Äôs . the quarrel which
had taken place between prisoner and his stepmother was freely
admitted, but both it and his financial embarrassments had been grossly
exaggerated .

his learned friend‚Äîsir ernest nodded carelessly at mr . philips‚Äîhad
stated that if the prisoner were an innocent man, he would have come
forward at the inquest to explain that it was he, and not mr .
inglethorp, who had been the participator in the quarrel . he thought
the facts had been misrepresented . what had actually occurred was this .
the prisoner, returning to the house on tuesday evening, had been
authoritatively told that there had been a violent quarrel between mr .
and mrs . inglethorp . no suspicion had entered the prisoner‚Äôs head that
anyone could possibly have mistaken his voice for that of mr .
inglethorp . he naturally concluded that his stepmother had had two
quarrels .

the prosecution averred that on monday, july 16th, the prisoner had
entered the chemist‚Äôs shop in the village, disguised as mr . inglethorp .
the prisoner, on the contrary, was at that time at a lonely spot called
marston‚Äôs spinney, where he had been summoned by an anonymous note,
couched in blackmailing terms, and threatening to reveal certain
matters to his wife unless he complied with its demands . the prisoner
had, accordingly, gone to the appointed spot, and after waiting there
vainly for half an hour had returned home . unfortunately, he had met
with no one on the way there or back who could vouch for the truth of
his story, but luckily he had kept the note, and it would be produced
as evidence .

as for the statement relating to the destruction of the will, the
prisoner had formerly practised at the bar, and was perfectly well
aware that the will made in his favour a year before was automatically
revoked by his stepmother‚Äôs remarriage . he would call evidence to show
who did destroy the will, and it was possible that that might open up
quite a new view of the case .

finally, he would point out to the jury that there was evidence against
other people besides john cavendish . he would direct their attention to
the fact that the evidence against mr . lawrence cavendish was quite as
strong, if not stronger than that against his brother .

he would now call the prisoner .

john acquitted himself well in the witness-box . under sir ernest‚Äôs
skilful handling, he told his tale credibly and well . the anonymous
note received by him was produced, and handed to the jury to examine .
the readiness with which he admitted his financial difficulties, and
the disagreement with his stepmother, lent value to his denials .

at the close of his examination, he paused, and said:

‚Äúi should like to make one thing clear . i utterly reject and disapprove
of sir ernest heavywether‚Äôs insinuations against my brother . my
brother, i am convinced, had no more to do with the crime than i have .‚Äù

sir ernest merely smiled, and noted with a sharp eye that john‚Äôs
protest had produced a very favourable impression on the jury .

then the cross-examination began .

‚Äúi understand you to say that it never entered your head that the
witnesses at the inquest could possibly have mistaken your voice for
that of mr . inglethorp . is not that very surprising ?‚Äù

‚Äúno, i don‚Äôt think so . i was told there had been a quarrel between my
mother and mr . inglethorp, and it never occurred to me that such was
not really the case .‚Äù

‚Äúnot when the servant dorcas repeated certain fragments of the
conversation‚Äîfragments which you must have recognized ?‚Äù

‚Äúi did not recognize them .‚Äù

‚Äúyour memory must be unusually short !‚Äù

‚Äúno, but we were both angry, and, i think, said more than we meant . i
paid very little attention to my mother‚Äôs actual words .‚Äù

mr . philips‚Äô incredulous sniff was a triumph of forensic skill . he
passed on to the subject of the note .

‚Äúyou have produced this note very opportunely . tell me, is there
nothing familiar about the hand-writing of it ?‚Äù

‚Äúnot that i know of .‚Äù

‚Äúdo you not think that it bears a marked resemblance to your own
hand-writing‚Äîcarelessly disguised ?‚Äù

‚Äúno, i do not think so .‚Äù

‚Äúi put it to you that it is your own hand-writing !‚Äù

‚Äúno .‚Äù

‚Äúi put it to you that, anxious to prove an alibi, you conceived the
idea of a fictitious and rather incredible appointment, and wrote this
note yourself in order to bear out your statement !‚Äù

‚Äúno .‚Äù

‚Äúis it not a fact that, at the time you claim to have been waiting
about at a solitary and unfrequented spot, you were really in the
chemist‚Äôs shop in styles st . mary, where you purchased strychnine in
the name of alfred inglethorp ?‚Äù

‚Äúno, that is a lie .‚Äù

‚Äúi put it to you that, wearing a suit of mr . inglethorp‚Äôs clothes, with
a black beard trimmed to resemble his, you were there‚Äîand signed the
register in his name !‚Äù

‚Äúthat is absolutely untrue .‚Äù

‚Äúthen i will leave the remarkable similarity of hand-writing between
the note, the register, and your own, to the consideration of the
jury,‚Äù said mr . philips, and sat down with the air of a man who has
done his duty, but who was nevertheless horrified by such deliberate
perjury .

after this, as it was growing late, the case was adjourned till monday .

poirot, i noticed, was looking profoundly discouraged . he had that
little frown between the eyes that i knew so well .

‚Äúwhat is it, poirot ?‚Äù i inquired .

‚Äúah, _mon ami_, things are going badly, badly .‚Äù

in spite of myself, my heart gave a leap of relief . evidently there was
a likelihood of john cavendish being acquitted .

when we reached the house, my little friend waved aside mary‚Äôs offer of
tea .

‚Äúno, i thank you, madame . i will mount to my room .‚Äù

i followed him . still frowning, he went across to the desk and took out
a small pack of patience cards . then he drew up a chair to the table,
and, to my utter amazement, began solemnly to build card houses !

my jaw dropped involuntarily, and he said at once:

‚Äúno, _mon ami_, i am not in my second childhood ! i steady my nerves,
that is all . this employment requires precision of the fingers . with
precision of the fingers goes precision of the brain . and never have i
needed that more than now !‚Äù

‚Äúwhat is the trouble ?‚Äù i asked .

with a great thump on the table, poirot demolished his carefully built
up edifice .

‚Äúit is this, _mon ami !_ that i can build card houses seven stories
high, but i cannot‚Äù‚Äîthump‚Äî‚Äúfind‚Äù‚Äîthump‚Äî‚Äú that last link of which i
spoke to you .‚Äù

i could not quite tell what to say, so i held my peace, and he began
slowly building up the cards again, speaking in jerks as he did so .

‚Äúit is done‚Äîso ! by placing‚Äîone card‚Äîon another‚Äîwith
mathematical‚Äîprecision !‚Äù

i watched the card house rising under his hands, story by story . he
never hesitated or faltered . it was really almost like a conjuring
trick .

‚Äúwhat a steady hand you‚Äôve got,‚Äù i remarked . ‚Äúi believe i‚Äôve only seen
your hand shake once .‚Äù

‚Äúon an occasion when i was enraged, without doubt,‚Äù observed poirot,
with great placidity .

‚Äúyes indeed ! you were in a towering rage . do you remember ? it was when
you discovered that the lock of the despatch-case in mrs . inglethorp‚Äôs
bedroom had been forced . you stood by the mantelpiece, twiddling the
things on it in your usual fashion, and your hand shook like a leaf ! i
must say‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù

but i stopped suddenly . for poirot, uttering a hoarse and inarticulate
cry, again annihilated his masterpiece of cards, and putting his hands
over his eyes swayed backwards and forwards, apparently suffering the
keenest agony .

‚Äúgood heavens, poirot !‚Äù i cried . ‚Äúwhat is the matter ? are you taken
ill ?‚Äù

‚Äúno, no,‚Äù he gasped . ‚Äúit is‚Äîit is‚Äîthat i have an idea !‚Äù

‚Äúoh !‚Äù i exclaimed, much relieved . ‚Äúone of your ‚Äòlittle ideas‚Äô ?‚Äù

‚Äúah, _ma foi_, no !‚Äù replied poirot frankly . ‚Äúthis time it is an idea
gigantic ! stupendous ! and you‚Äî_you_, my friend, have given it to me !‚Äù

suddenly clasping me in his arms, he kissed me warmly on both cheeks,
and before i had recovered from my surprise ran headlong from the room .

mary cavendish entered at that moment .

‚Äúwhat _is_ the matter with monsieur poirot ? he rushed past me crying
out: ‚Äòa garage ! for the love of heaven, direct me to a garage, madame !‚Äô
and, before i could answer, he had dashed out into the street .‚Äù

i hurried to the window . true enough, there he was, tearing down the
street, hatless, and gesticulating as he went . i turned to mary with a
gesture of despair .

‚Äúhe‚Äôll be stopped by a policeman in another minute . there he goes,
round the corner !‚Äù

our eyes met, and we stared helplessly at one another .

‚Äúwhat can be the matter ?‚Äù

i shook my head .

‚Äúi don‚Äôt know . he was building card houses, when suddenly he said he
had an idea, and rushed off as you saw .‚Äù

‚Äúwell,‚Äù said mary, ‚Äúi expect he will be back before dinner .‚Äù

but night fell, and poirot had not returned .






chapter xii . the last link

poirot‚Äôs abrupt departure had intrigued us all greatly . sunday morning
wore away, and still he did not reappear . but about three o‚Äôclock a
ferocious and prolonged hooting outside drove us to the window, to see
poirot alighting from a car, accompanied by japp and summerhaye . the
little man was transformed . he radiated an absurd complacency . he bowed
with exaggerated respect to mary cavendish .

‚Äúmadame, i have your permission to hold a little _r√©union_ in the
_salon_ ? it is necessary for everyone to attend .‚Äù

mary smiled sadly .

‚Äúyou know, monsieur poirot, that you have _carte blanche_ in every
way .‚Äù

‚Äúyou are too amiable, madame .‚Äù

still beaming, poirot marshalled us all into the drawing-room, bringing
forward chairs as he did so .

‚Äúmiss howard‚Äîhere . mademoiselle cynthia . monsieur lawrence . the good
dorcas . and annie . _bien !_ we must delay our proceedings a few minutes
until mr . inglethorp arrives . i have sent him a note .‚Äù

miss howard rose immediately from her seat .

‚Äúif that man comes into the house, i leave it !‚Äù

‚Äúno, no !‚Äù poirot went up to her and pleaded in a low voice .

finally miss howard consented to return to her chair . a few minutes
later alfred inglethorp entered the room .

the company once assembled, poirot rose from his seat with the air of a
popular lecturer, and bowed politely to his audience .

‚Äú_messieurs, mesdames_, as you all know, i was called in by monsieur
john cavendish to investigate this case . i at once examined the bedroom
of the deceased which, by the advice of the doctors, had been kept
locked, and was consequently exactly as it had been when the tragedy
occurred . i found: first, a fragment of green material; second, a stain
on the carpet near the window, still damp; thirdly, an empty box of
bromide powders .

‚Äúto take the fragment of green material first, i found it caught in the
bolt of the communicating door between that room and the adjoining one
occupied by mademoiselle cynthia . i handed the fragment over to the
police who did not consider it of much importance . nor did they
recognize it for what it was‚Äîa piece torn from a green land armlet .‚Äù

there was a little stir of excitement .

‚Äúnow there was only one person at styles who worked on the land‚Äîmrs .
cavendish . therefore it must have been mrs . cavendish who entered the
deceased‚Äôs room through the door communicating with mademoiselle
cynthia‚Äôs room .‚Äù

‚Äúbut that door was bolted on the inside !‚Äù i cried .

‚Äúwhen i examined the room, yes . but in the first place we have only her
word for it, since it was she who tried that particular door and
reported it fastened . in the ensuing confusion she would have had ample
opportunity to shoot the bolt across . i took an early opportunity of
verifying my conjectures . to begin with, the fragment corresponds
exactly with a tear in mrs . cavendish‚Äôs armlet . also, at the inquest,
mrs . cavendish declared that she had heard, from her own room, the fall
of the table by the bed . i took an early opportunity of testing that
statement by stationing my friend monsieur hastings in the left wing of
the building, just outside mrs . cavendish‚Äôs door . i myself, in company
with the police, went to the deceased‚Äôs room, and whilst there i,
apparently accidentally, knocked over the table in question, but found
that, as i had expected, monsieur hastings had heard no sound at all .
this confirmed my belief that mrs . cavendish was not speaking the truth
when she declared that she had been dressing in her room at the time of
the tragedy . in fact, i was convinced that, far from having been in her
own room, mrs . cavendish was actually in the deceased‚Äôs room when the
alarm was given .‚Äù

i shot a quick glance at mary . she was very pale, but smiling .

‚Äúi proceeded to reason on that assumption . mrs . cavendish is in her
mother-in-law‚Äôs room . we will say that she is seeking for something and
has not yet found it . suddenly mrs . inglethorp awakens and is seized
with an alarming paroxysm . she flings out her arm, overturning the bed
table, and then pulls desperately at the bell . mrs . cavendish,
startled, drops her candle, scattering the grease on the carpet . she
picks it up, and retreats quickly to mademoiselle cynthia‚Äôs room,
closing the door behind her . she hurries out into the passage, for the
servants must not find her where she is . but it is too late ! already
footsteps are echoing along the gallery which connects the two wings .
what can she do ? quick as thought, she hurries back to the young girl‚Äôs
room, and starts shaking her awake . the hastily aroused household come
trooping down the passage . they are all busily battering at mrs .
inglethorp‚Äôs door . it occurs to nobody that mrs . cavendish has not
arrived with the rest, but‚Äîand this is significant‚Äîi can find no one
who saw her come from the other wing .‚Äù he looked at mary cavendish . ‚Äúam
i right, madame ?‚Äù

she bowed her head .

‚Äúquite right, monsieur . you understand that, if i had thought i would
do my husband any good by revealing these facts, i would have done so .
but it did not seem to me to bear upon the question of his guilt or
innocence .‚Äù

‚Äúin a sense, that is correct, madame . but it cleared my mind of many
misconceptions, and left me free to see other facts in their true
significance .‚Äù

‚Äúthe will !‚Äù cried lawrence . ‚Äúthen it was you, mary, who destroyed the
will ?‚Äù

she shook her head, and poirot shook his also .

‚Äúno,‚Äù he said quietly . ‚Äúthere is only one person who could possibly
have destroyed that will‚Äîmrs . inglethorp herself !‚Äù

‚Äúimpossible !‚Äù i exclaimed . ‚Äúshe had only made it out that very
afternoon !‚Äù

‚Äúnevertheless, _mon ami_, it was mrs . inglethorp . because, in no other
way can you account for the fact that, on one of the hottest days of
the year, mrs . inglethorp ordered a fire to be lighted in her room .‚Äù

i gave a gasp . what idiots we had been never to think of that fire as
being incongruous ! poirot was continuing:

‚Äúthe temperature on that day, messieurs, was 80 degrees in the shade .
yet mrs . inglethorp ordered a fire ! why ? because she wished to destroy
something, and could think of no other way . you will remember that, in
consequence of the war economics practiced at styles, no waste paper
was thrown away . there was therefore no means of destroying a thick
document such as a will . the moment i heard of a fire being lighted in
mrs . inglethorp‚Äôs room, i leaped to the conclusion that it was to
destroy some important document‚Äîpossibly a will . so the discovery of
the charred fragment in the grate was no surprise to me . i did not, of
course, know at the time that the will in question had only been made
this afternoon, and i will admit that, when i learnt that fact, i fell
into a grievous error . i came to the conclusion that mrs . inglethorp‚Äôs
determination to destroy her will arose as a direct consequence of the
quarrel she had that afternoon, and that therefore the quarrel took
place after, and not before the making of the will .

‚Äúhere, as we know, i was wrong, and i was forced to abandon that idea .
i faced the problem from a new standpoint . now, at four o‚Äôclock, dorcas
overheard her mistress saying angrily: ‚Äòyou need not think that any
fear of publicity, or scandal between husband and wife will deter me .‚Äù
i conjectured, and conjectured rightly, that these words were
addressed, not to her husband, but to mr . john cavendish . at five
o‚Äôclock, an hour later, she uses almost the same words, but the
standpoint is different . she admits to dorcas, ‚Äòi don‚Äôt know what to
do; scandal between husband and wife is a dreadful thing .‚Äô at four
o‚Äôclock she has been angry, but completely mistress of herself . at five
o‚Äôclock she is in violent distress, and speaks of having had a great
shock .

‚Äúlooking at the matter psychologically, i drew one deduction which i
was convinced was correct . the second ‚Äòscandal‚Äô she spoke of was not
the same as the first‚Äîand it concerned herself !

‚Äúlet us reconstruct . at four o‚Äôclock, mrs . inglethorp quarrels with her
son, and threatens to denounce him to his wife‚Äîwho, by the way,
overheard the greater part of the conversation . at four-thirty, mrs .
inglethorp, in consequence of a conversation on the validity of wills,
makes a will in favour of her husband, which the two gardeners witness .
at five o‚Äôclock, dorcas finds her mistress in a state of considerable
agitation, with a slip of paper‚Äî‚Äòa letter,‚Äô dorcas thinks‚Äîin her hand,
and it is then that she orders the fire in her room to be lighted .
presumably, then, between four-thirty and five o‚Äôclock, something has
occurred to occasion a complete revolution of feeling, since she is now
as anxious to destroy the will, as she was before to make it . what was
that something ?

‚Äúas far as we know, she was quite alone during that half-hour . nobody
entered or left that boudoir . what then occasioned this sudden change
of sentiment ?

‚Äúone can only guess, but i believe my guess to be correct . mrs .
inglethorp had no stamps in her desk . we know this, because later she
asked dorcas to bring her some . now in the opposite corner of the room
stood her husband‚Äôs desk‚Äîlocked . she was anxious to find some stamps,
and, according to my theory, she tried her own keys in the desk . that
one of them fitted i know . she therefore opened the desk, and in
searching for the stamps she came across something else‚Äîthat slip of
paper which dorcas saw in her hand, and which assuredly was never meant
for mrs . inglethorp‚Äôs eyes . on the other hand, mrs . cavendish believed
that the slip of paper to which her mother-in-law clung so tenaciously
was a written proof of her own husband‚Äôs infidelity . she demanded it
from mrs . inglethorp who assured her, quite truly, that it had nothing
to do with that matter . mrs . cavendish did not believe her . she thought
that mrs . inglethorp was shielding her stepson . now mrs . cavendish is a
very resolute woman, and, behind her mask of reserve, she was madly
jealous of her husband . she determined to get hold of that paper at all
costs, and in this resolution chance came to her aid . she happened to
pick up the key of mrs . inglethorp‚Äôs despatch-case, which had been lost
that morning . she knew that her mother-in-law invariably kept all
important papers in this particular case .

‚Äúmrs . cavendish, therefore, made her plans as only a woman driven
desperate through jealousy could have done . some time in the evening
she unbolted the door leading into mademoiselle cynthia‚Äôs room .
possibly she applied oil to the hinges, for i found that it opened
quite noiselessly when i tried it . she put off her project until the
early hours of the morning as being safer, since the servants were
accustomed to hearing her move about her room at that time . she dressed
completely in her land kit, and made her way quietly through
mademoiselle cynthia‚Äôs room into that of mrs . inglethorp .‚Äù

he paused a moment, and cynthia interrupted:

‚Äúbut i should have woken up if anyone had come through my room ?‚Äù

‚Äúnot if you were drugged, mademoiselle .‚Äù

‚Äúdrugged ?‚Äù

‚Äú_mais, oui !_‚Äù

‚Äúyou remember‚Äù‚Äîhe addressed us collectively again‚Äî‚Äúthat through all the
tumult and noise next door mademoiselle cynthia slept . that admitted of
two possibilities . either her sleep was feigned‚Äîwhich i did not
believe‚Äîor her unconsciousness was indeed by artificial means .

‚Äúwith this latter idea in my mind, i examined all the coffee-cups most
carefully, remembering that it was mrs . cavendish who had brought
mademoiselle cynthia her coffee the night before . i took a sample from
each cup, and had them analysed‚Äîwith no result . i had counted the cups
carefully, in the event of one having been removed . six persons had
taken coffee, and six cups were duly found . i had to confess myself
mistaken .

‚Äúthen i discovered that i had been guilty of a very grave oversight .
coffee had been brought in for seven persons, not six, for dr .
bauerstein had been there that evening . this changed the face of the
whole affair, for there was now one cup missing . the servants noticed
nothing, since annie, the housemaid, who took in the coffee, brought in
seven cups, not knowing that mr . inglethorp never drank it, whereas
dorcas, who cleared them away the following morning, found six as
usual‚Äîor strictly speaking she found five, the sixth being the one
found broken in mrs . inglethorp‚Äôs room .

‚Äúi was confident that the missing cup was that of mademoiselle cynthia .
i had an additional reason for that belief in the fact that all the
cups found contained sugar, which mademoiselle cynthia never took in
her coffee . my attention was attracted by the story of annie about some
‚Äòsalt‚Äô on the tray of cocoa which she took every night to mrs .
inglethorp‚Äôs room . i accordingly secured a sample of that cocoa, and
sent it to be analysed .‚Äù

‚Äúbut that had already been done by dr . bauerstein,‚Äù said lawrence
quickly .

‚Äúnot exactly . the analyst was asked by him to report whether strychnine
was, or was not, present . he did not have it tested, as i did, for a
narcotic .‚Äù

‚Äúfor a narcotic ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes . here is the analyst‚Äôs report . mrs . cavendish administered a safe,
but effectual, narcotic to both mrs . inglethorp and mademoiselle
cynthia . and it is possible that she had a _mauvais quart d‚Äôheure_ in
consequence ! imagine her feelings when her mother-in-law is suddenly
taken ill and dies, and immediately after she hears the word ‚Äòpoison‚Äô !
she has believed that the sleeping draught she administered was
perfectly harmless, but there is no doubt that for one terrible moment
she must have feared that mrs . inglethorp‚Äôs death lay at her door . she
is seized with panic, and under its influence she hurries downstairs,
and quickly drops the coffee-cup and saucer used by mademoiselle
cynthia into a large brass vase, where it is discovered later by
monsieur lawrence . the remains of the cocoa she dare not touch . too
many eyes are upon her . guess at her relief when strychnine is
mentioned, and she discovers that after all the tragedy is not her
doing .

‚Äúwe are now able to account for the symptoms of strychnine poisoning
being so long in making their appearance . a narcotic taken with
strychnine will delay the action of the poison for some hours .‚Äù

poirot paused . mary looked up at him, the colour slowly rising in her
face .

‚Äúall you have said is quite true, monsieur poirot . it was the most
awful hour of my life . i shall never forget it . but you are wonderful .
i understand now‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù

‚Äúwhat i meant when i told you that you could safely confess to papa
poirot, eh ? but you would not trust me .‚Äù

‚Äúi see everything now,‚Äù said lawrence . ‚Äúthe drugged cocoa, taken on top
of the poisoned coffee, amply accounts for the delay .‚Äù

‚Äúexactly . but was the coffee poisoned, or was it not ? we come to a
little difficulty here, since mrs . inglethorp never drank it .‚Äù

‚Äúwhat ?‚Äù the cry of surprise was universal .

‚Äúno . you will remember my speaking of a stain on the carpet in mrs .
inglethorp‚Äôs room ? there were some peculiar points about that stain . it
was still damp, it exhaled a strong odour of coffee, and imbedded in
the nap of the carpet i found some little splinters of china . what had
happened was plain to me, for not two minutes before i had placed my
little case on the table near the window, and the table, tilting up,
had deposited it upon the floor on precisely the identical spot . in
exactly the same way, mrs . inglethorp had laid down her cup of coffee
on reaching her room the night before, and the treacherous table had
played her the same trick .

‚Äúwhat happened next is mere guess work on my part, but i should say
that mrs . inglethorp picked up the broken cup and placed it on the
table by the bed . feeling in need of a stimulant of some kind, she
heated up her cocoa, and drank it off then and there . now we are faced
with a new problem . we know the cocoa contained no strychnine . the
coffee was never drunk . yet the strychnine must have been administered
between seven and nine o‚Äôclock that evening . what third medium was
there‚Äîa medium so suitable for disguising the taste of strychnine that
it is extraordinary no one has thought of it ?‚Äù poirot looked round the
room, and then answered himself impressively . ‚Äúher medicine !‚Äù

‚Äúdo you mean that the murderer introduced the strychnine into her
tonic ?‚Äù i cried .

‚Äúthere was no need to introduce it . it was already there‚Äîin the
mixture . the strychnine that killed mrs . inglethorp was the identical
strychnine prescribed by dr . wilkins . to make that clear to you, i will
read you an extract from a book on dispensing which i found in the
dispensary of the red cross hospital at tadminster:

‚Äú‚Äòthe following prescription has become famous in text books:


          strychninae sulph .  .  .  .  .  . 1 gr .

          potass bromide  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 3vi

          aqua ad .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 3viii

          fiat mistura


_this solution deposits in a few hours the greater part of the
strychnine salt as an insoluble bromide in transparent crystals . a lady
in england lost her life by taking a similar mixture: the precipitated
strychnine collected at the bottom, and in taking the last dose she
swallowed nearly all of it !_

‚Äúnow there was, of course, no bromide in dr . wilkins‚Äô prescription, but
you will remember that i mentioned an empty box of bromide powders . one
or two of those powders introduced into the full bottle of medicine
would effectually precipitate the strychnine, as the book describes,
and cause it to be taken in the last dose . you will learn later that
the person who usually poured out mrs . inglethorp‚Äôs medicine was always
extremely careful not to shake the bottle, but to leave the sediment at
the bottom of it undisturbed .

‚Äúthroughout the case, there have been evidences that the tragedy was
intended to take place on monday evening . on that day, mrs .
inglethorp‚Äôs bell wire was neatly cut, and on monday evening
mademoiselle cynthia was spending the night with friends, so that mrs .
inglethorp would have been quite alone in the right wing, completely
shut off from help of any kind, and would have died, in all
probability, before medical aid could have been summoned . but in her
hurry to be in time for the village entertainment mrs . inglethorp
forgot to take her medicine, and the next day she lunched away from
home, so that the last‚Äîand fatal‚Äîdose was actually taken twenty-four
hours later than had been anticipated by the murderer; and it is owing
to that delay that the final proof‚Äîthe last link of the chain‚Äîis now in
my hands .‚Äù

amid breathless excitement, he held out three thin strips of paper .

‚Äúa letter in the murderer‚Äôs own hand-writing, _mes amis !_ had it been a
little clearer in its terms, it is possible that mrs . inglethorp,
warned in time, would have escaped . as it was, she realized her danger,
but not the manner of it .‚Äù

in the deathly silence, poirot pieced together the slips of paper and,
clearing his throat, read:

dearest evelyn:

    ‚Äòyou will be anxious at hearing nothing . it is all right‚Äîonly it
    will be to-night instead of last night . you understand . there‚Äôs a
    good time coming once the old woman is dead and out of the way . no
    one can possibly bring home the crime to me . that idea of yours
    about the bromides was a stroke of genius ! but we must be very
    circumspect . a false step‚Äî‚Äî‚Äô


‚Äúhere, my friends, the letter breaks off . doubtless the writer was
interrupted; but there can be no question as to his identity . we all
know this hand-writing and‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù

a howl that was almost a scream broke the silence .

‚Äúyou devil ! how did you get it ?‚Äù

a chair was overturned . poirot skipped nimbly aside . a quick movement
on his part, and his assailant fell with a crash .

‚Äú_messieurs, mesdames_,‚Äù said poirot, with a flourish, ‚Äúlet me
introduce you to the murderer, mr . alfred inglethorp !‚Äù






chapter xiii . poirot explains

‚Äúpoirot, you old villain,‚Äù i said, ‚Äúi‚Äôve half a mind to strangle you !
what do you mean by deceiving me as you have done ?‚Äù

we were sitting in the library . several hectic days lay behind us . in
the room below, john and mary were together once more, while alfred
inglethorp and miss howard were in custody . now at last, i had poirot
to myself, and could relieve my still burning curiosity .

poirot did not answer me for a moment, but at last he said:

‚Äúi did not deceive you, _mon ami_ . at most, i permitted you to deceive
yourself .‚Äù

‚Äúyes, but why ?‚Äù

‚Äúwell, it is difficult to explain . you see, my friend, you have a
nature so honest, and a countenance so transparent, that‚Äî_enfin_, to
conceal your feelings is impossible ! if i had told you my ideas, the
very first time you saw mr . alfred inglethorp that astute gentleman
would have‚Äîin your so expressive idiom‚Äî‚Äòsmelt a rat‚Äô ! and then,
_bonjour_ to our chances of catching him !‚Äù

‚Äúi think that i have more diplomacy than you give me credit for .‚Äù

‚Äúmy friend,‚Äù besought poirot, ‚Äúi implore you, do not enrage yourself !
your help has been of the most invaluable . it is but the extremely
beautiful nature that you have, which made me pause .‚Äù

‚Äúwell,‚Äù i grumbled, a little mollified . ‚Äúi still think you might have
given me a hint .‚Äù

‚Äúbut i did, my friend . several hints . you would not take them . think
now, did i ever say to you that i believed john cavendish guilty ? did i
not, on the contrary, tell you that he would almost certainly be
acquitted ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes, but‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù

‚Äúand did i not immediately afterwards speak of the difficulty of
bringing the murderer to justice ? was it not plain to you that i was
speaking of two entirely different persons ?‚Äù

‚Äúno,‚Äù i said, ‚Äúit was not plain to me !‚Äù

‚Äúthen again,‚Äù continued poirot, ‚Äúat the beginning, did i not repeat to
you several times that i didn‚Äôt want mr . inglethorp arrested _now_ ?
that should have conveyed something to you .‚Äù

‚Äúdo you mean to say you suspected him as long ago as that ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes . to begin with, whoever else might benefit by mrs . inglethorp‚Äôs
death, her husband would benefit the most . there was no getting away
from that . when i went up to styles with you that first day, i had no
idea as to how the crime had been committed, but from what i knew of
mr . inglethorp i fancied that it would be very hard to find anything to
connect him with it . when i arrived at the ch√¢teau, i realized at once
that it was mrs . inglethorp who had burnt the will; and there, by the
way, you cannot complain, my friend, for i tried my best to force on
you the significance of that bedroom fire in midsummer .‚Äù

‚Äúyes, yes,‚Äù i said impatiently . ‚Äúgo on .‚Äù

‚Äúwell, my friend, as i say, my views as to mr . inglethorp‚Äôs guilt were
very much shaken . there was, in fact, so much evidence against him that
i was inclined to believe that he had not done it .‚Äù

‚Äúwhen did you change your mind ?‚Äù

‚Äúwhen i found that the more efforts i made to clear him, the more
efforts he made to get himself arrested . then, when i discovered that
inglethorp had nothing to do with mrs . raikes and that in fact it was
john cavendish who was interested in that quarter, i was quite sure .‚Äù

‚Äúbut why ?‚Äù

‚Äúsimply this . if it had been inglethorp who was carrying on an intrigue
with mrs . raikes, his silence was perfectly comprehensible . but, when i
discovered that it was known all over the village that it was john who
was attracted by the farmer‚Äôs pretty wife, his silence bore quite a
different interpretation . it was nonsense to pretend that he was afraid
of the scandal, as no possible scandal could attach to him . this
attitude of his gave me furiously to think, and i was slowly forced to
the conclusion that alfred inglethorp wanted to be arrested . _eh bien !_
from that moment, i was equally determined that he should not be
arrested .‚Äù

‚Äúwait a minute . i don‚Äôt see why he wished to be arrested ?‚Äù

‚Äúbecause, _mon ami_, it is the law of your country that a man once
acquitted can never be tried again for the same offence . aha ! but it
was clever‚Äîhis idea ! assuredly, he is a man of method . see here, he
knew that in his position he was bound to be suspected, so he conceived
the exceedingly clever idea of preparing a lot of manufactured evidence
against himself . he wished to be arrested . he would then produce his
irreproachable alibi‚Äîand, hey presto, he was safe for life !‚Äù

‚Äúbut i still don‚Äôt see how he managed to prove his alibi, and yet go to
the chemist‚Äôs shop ?‚Äù

poirot stared at me in surprise .

‚Äúis it possible ? my poor friend ! you have not yet realized that it was
miss howard who went to the chemist‚Äôs shop ?‚Äù

‚Äúmiss howard ?‚Äù

‚Äúbut, certainly . who else ? it was most easy for her . she is of a good
height, her voice is deep and manly; moreover, remember, she and
inglethorp are cousins, and there is a distinct resemblance between
them, especially in their gait and bearing . it was simplicity itself .
they are a clever pair !‚Äù

‚Äúi am still a little fogged as to how exactly the bromide business was
done,‚Äù i remarked .

‚Äú_bon !_ i will reconstruct for you as far as possible . i am inclined to
think that miss howard was the master mind in that affair . you remember
her once mentioning that her father was a doctor ? possibly she
dispensed his medicines for him, or she may have taken the idea from
one of the many books lying about when mademoiselle cynthia was
studying for her exam . anyway, she was familiar with the fact that the
addition of a bromide to a mixture containing strychnine would cause
the precipitation of the latter . probably the idea came to her quite
suddenly . mrs . inglethorp had a box of bromide powders, which she
occasionally took at night . what could be easier than quietly to
dissolve one or more of those powders in mrs . inglethorp‚Äôs large sized
bottle of medicine when it came from coot‚Äôs ? the risk is practically
nil . the tragedy will not take place until nearly a fortnight later . if
anyone has seen either of them touching the medicine, they will have
forgotten it by that time . miss howard will have engineered her
quarrel, and departed from the house . the lapse of time, and her
absence, will defeat all suspicion . yes, it was a clever idea ! if they
had left it alone, it is possible the crime might never have been
brought home to them . but they were not satisfied . they tried to be too
clever‚Äîand that was their undoing .‚Äù

poirot puffed at his tiny cigarette, his eyes fixed on the ceiling .

‚Äúthey arranged a plan to throw suspicion on john cavendish, by buying
strychnine at the village chemist‚Äôs, and signing the register in his
hand-writing .

‚Äúon monday mrs . inglethorp will take the last dose of her medicine . on
monday, therefore, at six o‚Äôclock, alfred inglethorp arranges to be
seen by a number of people at a spot far removed from the village . miss
howard has previously made up a cock and bull story about him and mrs .
raikes to account for his holding his tongue afterwards . at six
o‚Äôclock, miss howard, disguised as alfred inglethorp, enters the
chemist‚Äôs shop, with her story about a dog, obtains the strychnine, and
writes the name of alfred inglethorp in john‚Äôs handwriting, which she
had previously studied carefully .

‚Äúbut, as it will never do if john, too, can prove an alibi, she writes
him an anonymous note‚Äîstill copying his hand-writing‚Äîwhich takes him to
a remote spot where it is exceedingly unlikely that anyone will see
him .

‚Äúso far, all goes well . miss howard goes back to middlingham . alfred
inglethorp returns to styles . there is nothing that can compromise him
in any way, since it is miss howard who has the strychnine, which,
after all, is only wanted as a blind to throw suspicion on john
cavendish .

‚Äúbut now a hitch occurs . mrs . inglethorp does not take her medicine
that night . the broken bell, cynthia‚Äôs absence‚Äîarranged by inglethorp
through his wife‚Äîall these are wasted . and then‚Äîhe makes his slip .

‚Äúmrs . inglethorp is out, and he sits down to write to his accomplice,
who, he fears, may be in a panic at the non-success of their plan . it
is probable that mrs . inglethorp returned earlier than he expected .
caught in the act, and somewhat flurried he hastily shuts and locks his
desk . he fears that if he remains in the room he may have to open it
again, and that mrs . inglethorp might catch sight of the letter before
he could snatch it up . so he goes out and walks in the woods, little
dreaming that mrs . inglethorp will open his desk, and discover the
incriminating document .

‚Äúbut this, as we know, is what happened . mrs . inglethorp reads it, and
becomes aware of the perfidy of her husband and evelyn howard, though,
unfortunately, the sentence about the bromides conveys no warning to
her mind . she knows that she is in danger‚Äîbut is ignorant of where the
danger lies . she decides to say nothing to her husband, but sits down
and writes to her solicitor, asking him to come on the morrow, and she
also determines to destroy immediately the will which she has just
made . she keeps the fatal letter .‚Äù

‚Äúit was to discover that letter, then, that her husband forced the lock
of the despatch-case ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes, and from the enormous risk he ran we can see how fully he
realized its importance . that letter excepted, there was absolutely
nothing to connect him with the crime .‚Äù

‚Äúthere‚Äôs only one thing i can‚Äôt make out, why didn‚Äôt he destroy it at
once when he got hold of it ?‚Äù

‚Äúbecause he did not dare take the biggest risk of all‚Äîthat of keeping
it on his own person .‚Äù

‚Äúi don‚Äôt understand .‚Äù

‚Äúlook at it from his point of view . i have discovered that there were
only five short minutes in which he could have taken it‚Äîthe five
minutes immediately before our own arrival on the scene, for before
that time annie was brushing the stairs, and would have seen anyone who
passed going to the right wing . figure to yourself the scene ! he enters
the room, unlocking the door by means of one of the other doorkeys‚Äîthey
were all much alike . he hurries to the despatch-case‚Äîit is locked, and
the keys are nowhere to be seen . that is a terrible blow to him, for it
means that his presence in the room cannot be concealed as he had
hoped . but he sees clearly that everything must be risked for the sake
of that damning piece of evidence . quickly, he forces the lock with a
penknife, and turns over the papers until he finds what he is looking
for .

‚Äúbut now a fresh dilemma arises: he dare not keep that piece of paper
on him . he may be seen leaving the room‚Äîhe may be searched . if the
paper is found on him, it is certain doom . probably, at this minute,
too, he hears the sounds below of mr . wells and john leaving the
boudoir . he must act quickly . where can he hide this terrible slip of
paper ? the contents of the waste-paper-basket are kept and in any case,
are sure to be examined . there are no means of destroying it; and he
dare not keep it . he looks round, and he sees‚Äîwhat do you think, _mon
ami ?_‚Äù

i shook my head .

‚Äúin a moment, he has torn the letter into long thin strips, and rolling
them up into spills he thrusts them hurriedly in amongst the other
spills in the vase on the mantle-piece .‚Äù

i uttered an exclamation .

‚Äúno one would think of looking there,‚Äù poirot continued . ‚Äúand he will
be able, at his leisure, to come back and destroy this solitary piece
of evidence against him .‚Äù

‚Äúthen, all the time, it was in the spill vase in mrs . inglethorp‚Äôs
bedroom, under our very noses ?‚Äù i cried .

poirot nodded .

‚Äúyes, my friend . that is where i discovered my ‚Äòlast link,‚Äô and i owe
that very fortunate discovery to you .‚Äù

‚Äúto me ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes . do you remember telling me that my hand shook as i was
straightening the ornaments on the mantelpiece ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes, but i don‚Äôt see‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù

‚Äúno, but i saw . do you know, my friend, i remembered that earlier in
the morning, when we had been there together, i had straightened all
the objects on the mantelpiece . and, if they were already straightened,
there would be no need to straighten them again, unless, in the
meantime, someone else had touched them .‚Äù

‚Äúdear me,‚Äù i murmured, ‚Äúso that is the explanation of your
extraordinary behaviour . you rushed down to styles, and found it still
there ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes, and it was a race for time .‚Äù

‚Äúbut i still can‚Äôt understand why inglethorp was such a fool as to
leave it there when he had plenty of opportunity to destroy it .‚Äù

‚Äúah, but he had no opportunity . _i_ saw to that .‚Äù

‚Äúyou ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes . do you remember reproving me for taking the household into my
confidence on the subject ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes .‚Äù

‚Äúwell, my friend, i saw there was just one chance . i was not sure then
if inglethorp was the criminal or not, but if he was i reasoned that he
would not have the paper on him, but would have hidden it somewhere,
and by enlisting the sympathy of the household i could effectually
prevent his destroying it . he was already under suspicion, and by
making the matter public i secured the services of about ten amateur
detectives, who would be watching him unceasingly, and being himself
aware of their watchfulness he would not dare seek further to destroy
the document . he was therefore forced to depart from the house, leaving
it in the spill vase .‚Äù

‚Äúbut surely miss howard had ample opportunities of aiding him .‚Äù

‚Äúyes, but miss howard did not know of the paper‚Äôs existence . in
accordance with their prearranged plan, she never spoke to alfred
inglethorp . they were supposed to be deadly enemies, and until john
cavendish was safely convicted they neither of them dared risk a
meeting . of course i had a watch kept on mr . inglethorp, hoping that
sooner or later he would lead me to the hiding-place . but he was too
clever to take any chances . the paper was safe where it was; since no
one had thought of looking there in the first week, it was not likely
they would do so afterwards . but for your lucky remark, we might never
have been able to bring him to justice .‚Äù

‚Äúi understand that now; but when did you first begin to suspect miss
howard ?‚Äù

‚Äúwhen i discovered that she had told a lie at the inquest about the
letter she had received from mrs . inglethorp .‚Äù

‚Äúwhy, what was there to lie about ?‚Äù

‚Äúyou saw that letter ? do you recall its general appearance ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes‚Äîmore or less .‚Äù

‚Äúyou will recollect, then, that mrs . inglethorp wrote a very
distinctive hand, and left large clear spaces between her words . but if
you look at the date at the top of the letter you will notice that
‚Äòjuly 17th‚Äô is quite different in this respect . do you see what i
mean ?‚Äù

‚Äúno,‚Äù i confessed, ‚Äúi don‚Äôt .‚Äù

‚Äúyou do not see that that letter was not written on the 17th, but on
the 7th‚Äîthe day after miss howard‚Äôs departure ? the ‚Äò1‚Äô was written in
before the ‚Äò7‚Äô to turn it into the ‚Äò17th‚Äô .‚Äù

‚Äúbut why ?‚Äù

‚Äúthat is exactly what i asked myself . why does miss howard suppress the
letter written on the 17th, and produce this faked one instead ? because
she did not wish to show the letter of the 17th . why, again ? and at
once a suspicion dawned in my mind . you will remember my saying that it
was wise to beware of people who were not telling you the truth .‚Äù

‚Äúand yet,‚Äù i cried indignantly, ‚Äúafter that, you gave me two reasons
why miss howard could not have committed the crime !‚Äù

‚Äúand very good reasons too,‚Äù replied poirot . ‚Äúfor a long time they were
a stumbling-block to me until i remembered a very significant fact:
that she and alfred inglethorp were cousins . she could not have
committed the crime single-handed, but the reasons against that did not
debar her from being an accomplice . and, then, there was that rather
over-vehement hatred of hers ! it concealed a very opposite emotion .
there was, undoubtedly, a tie of passion between them long before he
came to styles . they had already arranged their infamous plot‚Äîthat he
should marry this rich, but rather foolish old lady, induce her to make
a will leaving her money to him, and then gain their ends by a very
cleverly conceived crime . if all had gone as they planned, they would
probably have left england, and lived together on their poor victim‚Äôs
money .

‚Äúthey are a very astute and unscrupulous pair . while suspicion was to
be directed against him, she would be making quiet preparations for a
very different _d√©nouement_ . she arrives from middlingham with all the
compromising items in her possession . no suspicion attaches to her . no
notice is paid to her coming and going in the house . she hides the
strychnine and glasses in john‚Äôs room . she puts the beard in the attic .
she will see to it that sooner or later they are duly discovered .‚Äù

‚Äúi don‚Äôt quite see why they tried to fix the blame on john,‚Äù i
remarked . ‚Äúit would have been much easier for them to bring the crime
home to lawrence .‚Äù

‚Äúyes, but that was mere chance . all the evidence against him arose out
of pure accident . it must, in fact, have been distinctly annoying to
the pair of schemers .‚Äù

‚Äúhis manner was unfortunate,‚Äù i observed thoughtfully .

‚Äúyes . you realize, of course, what was at the back of that ?‚Äù

‚Äúno .‚Äù

‚Äúyou did not understand that he believed mademoiselle cynthia guilty of
the crime ?‚Äù

‚Äúno,‚Äù i exclaimed, astonished . ‚Äúimpossible !‚Äù

‚Äúnot at all . i myself nearly had the same idea . it was in my mind when
i asked mr . wells that first question about the will . then there were
the bromide powders which she had made up, and her clever male
impersonations, as dorcas recounted them to us . there was really more
evidence against her than anyone else .‚Äù

‚Äúyou are joking, poirot !‚Äù

‚Äúno . shall i tell you what made monsieur lawrence turn so pale when he
first entered his mother‚Äôs room on the fatal night ? it was because,
whilst his mother lay there, obviously poisoned, he saw, over your
shoulder, that the door into mademoiselle cynthia‚Äôs room was unbolted .‚Äù

‚Äúbut he declared that he saw it bolted !‚Äù i cried .

‚Äúexactly,‚Äù said poirot dryly . ‚Äúand that was just what confirmed my
suspicion that it was not . he was shielding mademoiselle cynthia .‚Äù

‚Äúbut why should he shield her ?‚Äù

‚Äúbecause he is in love with her .‚Äù

i laughed .

‚Äúthere, poirot, you are quite wrong ! i happen to know for a fact that,
far from being in love with her, he positively dislikes her .‚Äù

‚Äúwho told you that, _mon ami ?_‚Äù

‚Äúcynthia herself .‚Äù

‚Äú_la pauvre petite !_ and she was concerned ?‚Äù

‚Äúshe said that she did not mind at all .‚Äù

‚Äúthen she certainly did mind very much,‚Äù remarked poirot . ‚Äúthey are
like that‚Äî_les femmes !_‚Äù

‚Äúwhat you say about lawrence is a great surprise to me,‚Äù i said .

‚Äúbut why ? it was most obvious . did not monsieur lawrence make the sour
face every time mademoiselle cynthia spoke and laughed with his
brother ? he had taken it into his long head that mademoiselle cynthia
was in love with monsieur john . when he entered his mother‚Äôs room, and
saw her obviously poisoned, he jumped to the conclusion that
mademoiselle cynthia knew something about the matter . he was nearly
driven desperate . first he crushed the coffee-cup to powder under his
feet, remembering that _she_ had gone up with his mother the night
before, and he determined that there should be no chance of testing its
contents . thenceforward, he strenuously, and quite uselessly, upheld
the theory of ‚Äòdeath from natural causes‚Äô .‚Äù

‚Äúand what about the ‚Äòextra coffee-cup‚Äô ?‚Äù

‚Äúi was fairly certain that it was mrs . cavendish who had hidden it, but
i had to make sure . monsieur lawrence did not know at all what i meant;
but, on reflection, he came to the conclusion that if he could find an
extra coffee-cup anywhere his lady love would be cleared of suspicion .
and he was perfectly right .‚Äù

‚Äúone thing more . what did mrs . inglethorp mean by her dying words ?‚Äù

‚Äúthey were, of course, an accusation against her husband .‚Äù

‚Äúdear me, poirot,‚Äù i said with a sigh, ‚Äúi think you have explained
everything . i am glad it has all ended so happily . even john and his
wife are reconciled .‚Äù

‚Äúthanks to me .‚Äù

‚Äúhow do you mean‚Äîthanks to you ?‚Äù

‚Äúmy dear friend, do you not realize that it was simply and solely the
trial which has brought them together again ? that john cavendish still
loved his wife, i was convinced . also, that she was equally in love
with him . but they had drifted very far apart . it all arose from a
misunderstanding . she married him without love . he knew it . he is a
sensitive man in his way, he would not force himself upon her if she
did not want him . and, as he withdrew, her love awoke . but they are
both unusually proud, and their pride held them inexorably apart . he
drifted into an entanglement with mrs . raikes, and she deliberately
cultivated the friendship of dr . bauerstein . do you remember the day of
john cavendish‚Äôs arrest, when you found me deliberating over a big
decision ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes, i quite understood your distress .‚Äù

‚Äúpardon me, _mon ami_, but you did not understand it in the least . i
was trying to decide whether or not i would clear john cavendish at
once . i could have cleared him‚Äîthough it might have meant a failure to
convict the real criminals . they were entirely in the dark as to my
real attitude up to the very last moment‚Äîwhich partly accounts for my
success .‚Äù

‚Äúdo you mean that you could have saved john cavendish from being
brought to trial ?‚Äù

‚Äúyes, my friend . but i eventually decided in favour of ‚Äòa woman‚Äôs
happiness‚Äô . nothing but the great danger through which they have passed
could have brought these two proud souls together again .‚Äù

i looked at poirot in silent amazement . the colossal cheek of the
little man ! who on earth but poirot would have thought of a trial for
murder as a restorer of conjugal happiness !

‚Äúi perceive your thoughts, _mon ami_,‚Äù said poirot, smiling at me . ‚Äúno
one but hercule poirot would have attempted such a thing ! and you are
wrong in condemning it . the happiness of one man and one woman is the
greatest thing in all the world .‚Äù

his words took me back to earlier events . i remembered mary as she lay
white and exhausted on the sofa, listening, listening . there had come
the sound of the bell below . she had started up . poirot had opened the
door, and meeting her agonized eyes had nodded gently . ‚Äúyes, madame,‚Äù
he said . ‚Äúi have brought him back to you .‚Äù he had stood aside, and as i
went out i had seen the look in mary‚Äôs eyes, as john cavendish had
caught his wife in his arms .

‚Äúperhaps you are right, poirot,‚Äù i said gently . ‚Äúyes, it is the
greatest thing in the world .‚Äù

suddenly, there was a tap at the door, and cynthia peeped in .

‚Äúi‚Äîi only‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù

‚Äúcome in,‚Äù i said, springing up .

she came in, but did not sit down .

‚Äúi‚Äîonly wanted to tell you something‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù

‚Äúyes ?‚Äù

cynthia fidgeted with a little tassel for some moments, then, suddenly
exclaiming: ‚Äúyou dears !‚Äù kissed first me and then poirot, and rushed
out of the room again .

‚Äúwhat on earth does this mean ?‚Äù i asked, surprised .

it was very nice to be kissed by cynthia, but the publicity of the
salute rather impaired the pleasure .

‚Äúit means that she has discovered monsieur lawrence does not dislike
her as much as she thought,‚Äù replied poirot philosophically .

‚Äúbut‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù

‚Äúhere he is .‚Äù

lawrence at that moment passed the door .

‚Äúeh ! monsieur lawrence,‚Äù called poirot . ‚Äúwe must congratulate you, is
it not so ?‚Äù

lawrence blushed, and then smiled awkwardly . a man in love is a sorry
spectacle . now cynthia had looked charming .

i sighed .

‚Äúwhat is it, _mon ami ?_‚Äù

‚Äúnothing,‚Äù i said sadly . ‚Äúthey are two delightful women !‚Äù

‚Äúand neither of them is for you ?‚Äù finished poirot . ‚Äúnever mind . console
yourself, my friend . we may hunt together again, who knows ? and then‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù

chapter i . i go to styles

the intense interest aroused in the public by what was known at the
time as ‚Äúthe styles case‚Äù has now somewhat subsided . nevertheless, in
[7m--More--(0%)[27mview of the world-wide notoriety which attended it, i have been asked,
both by my friend poirot and the family themselves, to write an account
of the whole story . this, we trust, will effectually silence the
sensational rumours which still persist .

i will therefore briefly set down the circumstances which led to my
being connected with the affair .

i had been invalided home from the front; and, after spending some
months in a rather depressing convalescent home, was given a month‚Äôs
sick leave . having no near relations or friends, i was trying to make
up my mind what to do, when i ran across john cavendish . i had seen
very little of him for some years . indeed, i had never known him
particularly well . he was a good fifteen years my senior, for one
thing, though he hardly looked his forty-five years . as a boy, though,
i had often stayed at styles, his mother‚Äôs place in essex .

we had a good yarn about old times, and it ended in his inviting me
down to styles to spend my leave there .

‚Äúthe mater will be delighted to see you again‚Äîafter all those years,‚Äù
he added .

‚Äúyour mother keeps well ?‚Äù i asked .

‚Äúoh, yes . i suppose you know that she has married again ?‚Äù

i am afraid i showed my surprise rather plainly . mrs . cavendish, who
had married john‚Äôs father when he was a widower with two sons, had been
a handsome woman of middle-age as i remembered her . she certainly could
not be a day less than seventy now . i recalled her as an energetic,
autocratic personality, somewhat inclined to charitable and social
notoriety, with a fondness for opening bazaars and playing the lady
bountiful . she was a most generous woman, and possessed a considerable
fortune of her own .

their country-place, styles court, had been purchased by mr . cavendish
early in their married life . he had been completely under his wife‚Äôs
ascendancy, so much so that, on dying, he left the place to her for her
lifetime, as well as the larger part of his income; an arrangement that
was distinctly unfair to his two sons . their step-mother, however, had
always been most generous to them; indeed, they were so young at the
time of their father‚Äôs remarriage that they always thought of her as
their own mother .

lawrence, the younger, had been a delicate youth . he had qualified as a
doctor but early relinquished the profession of medicine, and lived at
home while pursuing literary ambitions; though his verses never had any
marked success .

john practised for some time as a barrister, but had finally settled
down to the more congenial life of a country squire . he had married two
years ago, and had taken his wife to live at styles, though i
entertained a shrewd suspicion that he would have preferred his mother
to increase his allowance, which would have enabled him to have a home
of his own . mrs . cavendish, however, was a lady who liked to make her
own plans, and expected other people to fall in with them, and in this
case she certainly had the whip hand, namely: the purse strings .

john noticed my surprise at the news of his mother‚Äôs remarriage and
smiled rather ruefully .
[7m--More--(1%)[27m[K
‚Äúrotten little bounder too !‚Äù he said savagely . ‚Äúi can tell you,
hastings, it‚Äôs making life jolly difficult for us . as for evie‚Äîyou
remember evie ?‚Äù

‚Äúno .‚Äù

‚Äúoh, i suppose she was after your time . she‚Äôs the mater‚Äôs factotum,
companion, jack of all trades ! a great sport‚Äîold evie ! not precisely
young and beautiful, but as game as they make them .‚Äù

‚Äúyou were going to say‚Äî‚Äî ?‚Äù

‚Äúoh, this fellow ! he turned up from nowhere, on the pretext of being a
second cousin or something of evie‚Äôs, though she didn‚Äôt seem
particularly keen to acknowledge the relationship . the fellow is an
absolute outsider, anyone can see that . he‚Äôs got a great black beard,
and wears patent leather boots in all weathers ! but the mater cottoned
to him at once, took him on as secretary‚Äîyou know how she‚Äôs always
running a hundred societies ?‚Äù

i nodded .

‚Äúwell, of course the war has turned the hundreds into thousands . no
doubt the fellow was very useful to her . but you could have knocked us
all down with a feather when, three months ago, she suddenly announced
that she and alfred were engaged ! the fellow must be at least twenty
years younger than she is ! it‚Äôs simply bare-faced fortune hunting; but
there you are‚Äîshe is her own mistress, and she‚Äôs married him .‚Äù

‚Äúit must be a difficult situation for you all .‚Äù

‚Äúdifficult ! it‚Äôs damnable !‚Äù

thus it came about that, three days later, i descended from the train
at styles st . mary, an absurd little station, with no apparent reason
for existence, perched up in the midst of green fields and country
lanes . john cavendish was waiting on the platform, and piloted me out
to the car .

‚Äúgot a drop or two of petrol still, you see,‚Äù he remarked . ‚Äúmainly
owing to the mater‚Äôs activities .‚Äù

the village of styles st . mary was situated about two miles from the
little station, and styles court lay a mile the other side of it . it
was a still, warm day in early july . as one looked out over the flat
essex country, lying so green and peaceful under the afternoon sun, it
seemed almost impossible to believe that, not so very far away, a great
war was running its appointed course . i felt i had suddenly strayed
into another world . as we turned in at the lodge gates, john said:

‚Äúi‚Äôm afraid you‚Äôll find it very quiet down here, hastings .‚Äù

‚Äúmy dear fellow, that‚Äôs just what i want .‚Äù

‚Äúoh, it‚Äôs pleasant enough if you want to lead the idle life . i drill
with the volunteers twice a week, and lend a hand at the farms . my wife
works regularly ‚Äòon the land‚Äô . she is up at five every morning to milk,
and keeps at it steadily until lunchtime . it‚Äôs a jolly good life taking
it all round‚Äîif it weren‚Äôt for that fellow alfred inglethorp !‚Äù he
checked the car suddenly, and glanced at his watch . ‚Äúi wonder if we‚Äôve
[7m--More--(2%)[27mtime to pick up cynthia . no, she‚Äôll have started from the hospital by
now .‚Äù

‚Äúcynthia ! that‚Äôs not your wife ?‚Äù

‚Äúno, cynthia is a prot√©g√©e of my mother‚Äôs, the daughter of an old
schoolfellow of hers, who married a rascally solicitor . he came a
cropper, and the girl was left an orphan and penniless . my mother came
to the rescue, and cynthia has been with us nearly two years now . she
works in the red cross hospital at tadminster, seven miles away .‚Äù

as he spoke the last words, we drew up in front of the fine old house .
a lady in a stout tweed skirt, who was bending over a flower bed,
straightened herself at our approach .

‚Äúhullo, evie, here‚Äôs our wounded hero ! mr . hastings‚Äîmiss howard .‚Äù

miss howard shook hands with a hearty, almost painful, grip . i had an
impression of very blue eyes in a sunburnt face . she was a
pleasant-looking woman of about forty, with a deep voice, almost manly
in its stentorian tones, and had a large sensible square body, with
feet to match‚Äîthese last encased in good thick boots . her conversation,
i soon found, was couched in the telegraphic style .

‚Äúweeds grow like house afire . can‚Äôt keep even with ‚Äôem . shall press you
in . better be careful .‚Äù

‚Äúi‚Äôm sure i shall be only too delighted to make myself useful,‚Äù i
responded .

‚Äúdon‚Äôt say it . never does . wish you hadn‚Äôt later .‚Äù

‚Äúyou‚Äôre a cynic, evie,‚Äù said john, laughing . ‚Äúwhere‚Äôs tea to-day‚Äîinside
or out ?‚Äù

‚Äúout . too fine a day to be cooped up in the house .‚Äù

‚Äúcome on then, you‚Äôve done enough gardening for to-day . ‚Äòthe labourer
is worthy of his hire‚Äô, you know . come and be refreshed .‚Äù

‚Äúwell,‚Äù said miss howard, drawing off her gardening gloves, ‚Äúi‚Äôm
inclined to agree with you .‚Äù

she led the way round the house to where tea was spread under the shade
of a large sycamore .

a figure rose from one of the basket chairs, and came a few steps to
meet us .

‚Äúmy wife, hastings,‚Äù said john .

i shall never forget my first sight of mary cavendish . her tall,
slender form, outlined against the bright light; the vivid sense of
slumbering fire that seemed to find expression only in those wonderful
tawny eyes of hers, remarkable eyes, different from any other woman‚Äôs
that i have ever known; the intense power of stillness she possessed,
which nevertheless conveyed the impression of a wild untamed spirit in
an exquisitely civilised body‚Äîall these things are burnt into my
memory . i shall never forget them .

she greeted me with a few words of pleasant welcome in a low clear

case has now
somewhat subsided .
nevertheless , in
view of the
world wide notoriety
which attended it
, i have
been asked ,
both by my
friend poirot and
the family themselves
, to write
an account of
the whole story

we trust ,
will effectually silence
the sensational rumours
which still persist
. i will
therefore briefly set
down the circumstances
which led to
my being connected
with the affair

been invalided home
from the front

spending some months

had a good
yarn about old
times , and
it ended in
his inviting me
down to styles
to spend my
leave there .
the mater will
be delighted to
see you again
after all those
years , he
added . your
mother keeps well

. oh ,
yes . i
suppose you know
that she has
married again ?
