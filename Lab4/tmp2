the
intense
interest
aroused
in
the
public
by
what
was
known
at
the
time
as
the
styles
case
has
now
somewhat
subsided
.
nevertheless
,
in
view
of
the
world
wide
notoriety
which
attended
it
,
i
have
been
asked
,
both
by
my
friend
poirot
and
the
family
themselves
,
to
write
an
account
of
the
whole
story
.
this
,
we
trust
,
will
effectually
silence
the
sensational
rumours
which
still
persist
.
i
will
therefore
briefly
set
down
the
circumstances
which
led
to
my
being
connected
with
the
affair
.
i
had
been
invalided
home
from
the
front
and
,
after
spending
some
months
in
a
rather
depressing
convalescent
home
,
was
given
a
month
s
sick
leave
.
having
no
near
relations
or
friends
,
i
was
trying
to
make
up
my
mind
what
to
do
,
when
i
ran
across
john
cavendish
.
i
had
seen
very
little
of
him
for
some
years
.
indeed
,
i
had
never
known
him
particularly
well
.
he
was
a
good
fifteen
years
my
senior
,
for
one
thing
,
though
he
hardly
looked
his
forty
five
years
.
as
a
boy
,
though
,
i
had
often
stayed
at
styles
,
his
mother
s
place
in
essex
.
we
had
a
good
yarn
about
old
times
,
and
it
ended
in
his
inviting
me
down
to
styles
to
spend
my
leave
there
.
the
mater
will
be
delighted
to
see
you
again
after
all
those
years
,
he
added
.
your
mother
keeps
well
?
i
asked
.
oh
,
yes
.
i
suppose
you
know
that
she
has
married
again
?
i
am
afraid
i
showed
my
surprise
rather
plainly
.
mrs
.
cavendish
,
who
had
married
john
s
father
when
he
was
a
widower
with
two
sons
,
had
been
a
handsome
woman
of
middle
age
as
i
remembered
her
.
she
certainly
could
not
be
a
day
less
than
seventy
now
.
i
recalled
her
as
an
energetic
,
autocratic
personality
,
somewhat
inclined
to
charitable
and
social
notoriety
,
with
a
fondness
for
opening
bazaars
and
playing
the
lady
bountiful
.
she
was
a
most
generous
woman
,
and
possessed
a
considerable
fortune
of
her
own
.
their
country
place
,
styles
court
,
had
been
purchased
by
mr
.
cavendish
early
in
their
married
life
.
he
had
been
completely
under
his
wife
s
ascendancy
,
so
much
so
that
,
on
dying
,
he
left
the
place
to
her
for
her
lifetime
,
as
well
as
the
larger
part
of
his
income
an
arrangement
that
was
distinctly
unfair
to
his
two
sons
.
their
step
mother
,
however
,
had
always
been
most
generous
to
them
indeed
,
they
were
so
young
at
the
time
of
their
father
s
remarriage
that
they
always
thought
of
her
as
their
own
mother
.
lawrence
,
the
younger
,
had
been
a
delicate
youth
.
he
had
qualified
as
a
doctor
but
early
relinquished
the
profession
of
medicine
,
and
lived
at
home
while
pursuing
literary
ambitions
though
his
verses
never
had
any
marked
success
.
john
practised
for
some
time
as
a
barrister
,
but
had
finally
settled
down
to
the
more
congenial
life
of
a
country
squire
.
he
had
married
two
years
ago
,
and
had
taken
his
wife
to
live
at
styles
,
though
i
entertained
a
shrewd
suspicion
that
he
would
have
preferred
his
mother
to
increase
his
allowance
,
which
would
have
enabled
him
to
have
a
home
of
his
own
.
mrs
.
cavendish
,
however
,
was
a
lady
who
liked
to
make
her
own
plans
,
and
expected
other
people
to
fall
in
with
them
,
and
in
this
case
she
certainly
had
the
whip
hand
,
namely
the
purse
strings
.
john
noticed
my
surprise
at
the
news
of
his
mother
s
remarriage
and
smiled
rather
ruefully
.
rotten
little
bounder
too
!
he
said
savagely
.
i
can
tell
you
,
hastings
,
it
s
making
life
jolly
difficult
for
us
.
as
for
evie
you
remember
evie
?
no
.
oh
,
i
suppose
she
was
after
your
time
.
she
s
the
mater
s
factotum
,
companion
,
jack
of
all
trades
!
a
great
sport
old
evie
!
not
precisely
young
and
beautiful
,
but
as
game
as
they
make
them
.
you
were
going
to
say
?
oh
,
this
fellow
!
he
turned
up
from
nowhere
,
on
the
pretext
of
being
a
second
cousin
or
something
of
evie
s
,
though
she
didn
t
seem
particularly
keen
to
acknowledge
the
relationship
.
the
fellow
is
an
absolute
outsider
,
anyone
can
see
that
.
he
s
got
a
great
black
beard
,
and
wears
patent
leather
boots
in
all
weathers
!
but
the
mater
cottoned
to
him
at
once
,
took
him
on
as
secretary
you
know
how
she
s
always
running
a
hundred
societies
?
i
nodded
.
well
,
of
course
the
war
has
turned
the
hundreds
into
thousands
.
no
doubt
the
fellow
was
very
useful
to
her
.
but
you
could
have
knocked
us
all
down
with
a
feather
when
,
three
months
ago
,
she
suddenly
announced
that
she
and
alfred
were
engaged
!
the
fellow
must
be
at
least
twenty
years
younger
than
she
is
!
it
s
simply
bare
faced
fortune
hunting
but
there
you
are
she
is
her
own
mistress
,
and
she
s
married
him
.
it
must
be
a
difficult
situation
for
you
all
.
difficult
!
it
s
damnable
!
thus
it
came
about
that
,
three
days
later
,
i
descended
from
the
train
at
styles
st
.
mary
,
an
absurd
little
station
,
with
no
apparent
reason
for
existence
,
perched
up
in
the
midst
of
green
fields
and
country
lanes
.
john
cavendish
was
waiting
on
the
platform
,
and
piloted
me
out
to
the
car
.
got
a
drop
or
two
of
petrol
still
,
you
see
,
he
remarked
.
mainly
owing
to
the
mater
s
activities
.
the
village
of
styles
st
.
mary
was
situated
about
two
miles
from
the
little
station
,
and
styles
court
lay
a
mile
the
other
side
of
it
.
it
was
a
still
,
warm
day
in
early
july
.
as
one
looked
out
over
the
flat
essex
country
,
lying
so
green
and
peaceful
under
the
afternoon
sun
,
it
seemed
almost
impossible
to
believe
that
,
not
so
very
far
away
,
a
great
war
was
running
its
appointed
course
.
i
felt
i
had
suddenly
strayed
into
another
world
.
as
we
turned
in
at
the
lodge
gates
,
john
said
i
m
afraid
you
ll
find
it
very
quiet
down
here
,
hastings
.
my
dear
fellow
,
that
s
just
what
i
want
.
oh
,
it
s
pleasant
enough
if
you
want
to
lead
the
idle
life
.
i
drill
with
the
volunteers
twice
a
week
,
and
lend
a
hand
at
the
farms
.
my
wife
works
regularly
on
the
land
.
she
is
up
at
five
every
morning
to
milk
,
and
keeps
at
it
steadily
until
lunchtime
.
it
s
a
jolly
good
life
taking
it
all
round
if
it
weren
t
for
that
fellow
alfred
inglethorp
!
he
checked
the
car
suddenly
,
and
glanced
at
his
watch
.
i
wonder
if
we
ve
time
to
pick
up
cynthia
.
no
,
she
ll
have
started
from
the
hospital
by
now
.
cynthia
!
that
s
not
your
wife
?
no
,
cynthia
is
a
prot
g
e
of
my
mother
s
,
the
daughter
of
an
old
schoolfellow
of
hers
,
who
married
a
rascally
solicitor
.
he
came
a
cropper
,
and
the
girl
was
left
an
orphan
and
penniless
.
my
mother
came
to
the
rescue
,
and
cynthia
has
been
with
us
nearly
two
years
now
.
she
works
in
the
red
cross
hospital
at
tadminster
,
seven
miles
away
.
as
he
spoke
the
last
words
,
we
drew
up
in
front
of
the
fine
old
house
.
a
lady
in
a
stout
tweed
skirt
,
who
was
bending
over
a
flower
bed
,
straightened
herself
at
our
approach
.
hullo
,
evie
,
here
s
our
wounded
hero
!
mr
.
hastings
miss
howard
.
miss
howard
shook
hands
with
a
hearty
,
almost
painful
,
grip
.
i
had
an
impression
of
very
blue
eyes
in
a
sunburnt
face
.
she
was
a
pleasant
looking
woman
of
about
forty
,
with
a
deep
voice
,
almost
manly
in
its
stentorian
tones
,
and
had
a
large
sensible
square
body
,
with
feet
to
match
these
last
encased
in
good
thick
boots
.
her
conversation
,
i
soon
found
,
was
couched
in
the
telegraphic
style
.

like

press
you
in
.
better
be
careful
.
i
m
sure
i
shall
be
only
too
delighted
to
make
myself
useful
,
i
responded
.
don
t
say
it
.
never
does
.
wish
you
hadn
t
later
.
you
re
a
cynic
,
evie
,
said
john
,
laughing
.
where

inside
or
out
?
out
.
too
fine
a
day
to
be
cooped
up
in
the
house
.
come
on
then
,
you
ve
done
enough
gardening
for
to
day
.
the
labourer
is
worthy
of
his
hire
,
you
know
.
come
and
be
refreshed
.
well
,
said
miss
howard
,
drawing
off
her
gardening
gloves
,
i
m
inclined
to
agree
with
you
.
she
led
the
way
round
the
house
to
where
tea
was
spread
under
the
shade
of
a
large
sycamore
.
a
figure
rose
from
one
of
the
basket
chairs
,
and
came
a
few
steps
to
meet
us
.
my
wife
,
hastings
,
said
john
.
i
shall
never
forget
my
first
sight
of
mary
cavendish
.
her
tall
,
slender
form
,
outlined
against
the
bright
light
the
vivid
sense
of
slumbering
fire
that
seemed
to
find
expression
only
in
those
wonderful
tawny
eyes
of
hers
,
remarkable
eyes
,
different
from
any
other
woman
s
that
i
have
ever
known
the
intense
power
of
stillness
she
possessed
,
which
nevertheless
conveyed
the
impression
of
a
wild
untamed
spirit
in
an
exquisitely
civilised
body
all
these
things
are
burnt
into
my
memory
.
i
shall
never
forget
them
.
she
greeted
me
with
a
few
words
of
pleasant
welcome
in
a
low
clear
voice
,
and
i
sank
into
a
basket
chair
feeling
distinctly
glad
that
i
had
accepted
john
s
invitation
.
mrs
.
cavendish
gave
me
some
tea
,
and
her
few
quiet
remarks
heightened
my
first
impression
of
her
as
a
thoroughly
fascinating
woman
.
an
appreciative
listener
is
always
stimulating
,
and
i
described
,
in
a
humorous
manner
,
certain
incidents
of
my
convalescent
home
,
in
a
way
which
,
i
flatter
myself
,
greatly
amused
my
hostess
.
john
,
of
course
,
good
fellow
though
he
is
,
could
hardly
be
called
a
brilliant
conversationalist
.
at
that
moment
a
well
remembered
voice
floated
through
the
open
french
window
near
at
hand
then
you
ll
write
to
the
princess
after
tea
,
alfred
?
i
ll
write
to
lady
tadminster
for
the
second
day
,
myself
.
or
shall
we
wait
until
we
hear
from
the
princess
?
in
case
of
a
refusal
,
lady
tadminster
might
open
it
the
first
day
,
and
mrs
.
crosbie
the
second
.
then
there
s
the
duchess
about
the
school
f
te
.
there
was
the
murmur
of
a
man
s
voice
,
and
then
mrs
.
inglethorp
s
rose
in
reply
yes
,
certainly
.
after
tea
will
do
quite
well
.
you
are
so
thoughtful
,
alfred
dear
.
the
french
window
swung
open
a
little
wider
,
and
a
handsome
white
haired
old
lady
,
with
a
somewhat
masterful
cast
of
features
,
stepped
out
of
it
on
to
the
lawn
.
a
man
followed
her
,
a
suggestion
of
deference
in
his
manner
.
mrs
.
inglethorp
greeted
me
with
effusion
.
why
,
if
it
isn
t
too
delightful
to
see
you
again
,
mr
.
hastings
,
after
all
these
years
.
alfred
,
darling
,
mr
.
hastings
my
husband
.
i
looked
with
some
curiosity
at
alfred
darling
.
he
certainly
struck
a
rather
alien
note
.
i
did
not
wonder
at
john
objecting
to
his
beard
.
it
was
one
of
the
longest
and
blackest
i
have
ever
seen
.
he
wore
gold
rimmed
pince
nez
,
and
had
a
curious
impassivity
of
feature
.
it
struck
me
that
he
might
look
natural
on
a
stage
,
but
was
strangely
out
of
place
in
real
life
.
his
voice
was
rather
deep
and
unctuous
.
he
placed
a
wooden
hand
in
mine
and
said
this
is
a
pleasure
,
mr
.
hastings
.
then
,
turning
to
his
wife
emily
dearest
,
i
think
that
cushion
is
a
little
damp
.
she
beamed
fondly
on
him
,
as
he
substituted
another
with
every
demonstration
of
the
tenderest
care
.
strange
infatuation
of
an
otherwise
sensible
woman
!
with
the
presence
of
mr
.
inglethorp
,
a
sense
of
constraint
and
veiled
hostility
seemed
to
settle
down
upon
the
company
.
miss
howard
,
in
particular
,
took
no
pains
to
conceal
her
feelings
.
mrs
.
inglethorp
,
however
,
seemed
to
notice
nothing
unusual
.
her
volubility
,
which
i
remembered
of
old
,
had
lost
nothing
in
the
intervening
years
,
and
she
poured
out
a
steady
flood
of
conversation
,
mainly
on
the
subject
of
the
forthcoming
bazaar
which
she
was
organizing
and
which
was
to
take
place
shortly
.
occasionally
she
referred
to
her
husband
over
a
question
of
days
or
dates
.
his
watchful
and
attentive
manner
never
varied
.
from
the
very
first
i
took
a
firm
and
rooted
dislike
to
him
,
and
i
flatter
myself
that
my
first
judgments
are
usually
fairly
shrewd
.
presently
mrs
.
inglethorp
turned
to
give
some
instructions
about
letters
to
evelyn
howard
,
and
her
husband
addressed
me
in
his
painstaking
voice
is
soldiering
your
regular
profession
,
mr
.
hastings
?
no
,
before
the
war
i
was
in
lloyd
s
.
and
you
will
return
there
after
it
is
over
?
perhaps
.
either
that
or
a
fresh
start
altogether

mary
cavendish
leant
forward
.
what
would
you
really
choose
as
a
profession
,
if
you
could
just
consult
your
inclination
?
well
,
that
depends
.
no
secret
hobby
?
she
asked
.
tell
me
you
re
drawn
to
something
?
everyone
is
usually
something
absurd
.
you
ll
laugh
at
me
.
she
smiled
.
perhaps
.
well
,
i
ve
always
had
a
secret
hankering
to
be
a
detective
!
the
real
thing
scotland
yard
?
or
sherlock
holmes
?
oh
,
sherlock
holmes
by
all
means
.
but
really
,
seriously
,
i
am
awfully
drawn
to
it
.
i
came
across
a
man
in
belgium
once
,
a
very
famous
detective
,
and
he
quite
inflamed
me
.
he
was
a
marvellous
little
fellow
.
he
used
to
say
that
all
good
detective
work
was
a
mere
matter
of
method
.
my
system
is
based
on
his
though
of
course
i
have
progressed
rather
further
.
he
was
a
funny
little
man
,
a
great
dandy
,
but
wonderfully
clever
.
like
a
good
detective
story
myself
,
remarked
miss
howard
.
lots
of
nonsense
written
,
though
.
criminal
discovered
in
last
chapter
.
everyone
dumbfounded
.
real
crime
you
d
know
at
once
.
there
have
been
a
great
number
of
undiscovered
crimes
,
i
argued
.
don
t
mean
the
police
,
but
the
people
that
are
right
in
it
.
the
family
.
you
couldn
t
really
hoodwink
them
.
they
d
know
.
then
,
i
said
,
much
amused
,
you
think
that
if
you
were
mixed
up
in
a
crime
,
say
a
murder
,
you
d
be
able
to
spot
the
murderer
right
off
?
of
course
i
should
.
mightn
t
be
able
to
prove
it
to
a
pack
of
lawyers
.
but
i
m
certain
i
d
know
.
i
d
feel
it
in
my
fingertips
if
he
came
near
me
.
it
might
be
a
she
,
i
suggested
.
might
.
but
murder
s
a
violent
crime
.
associate
it
more
with
a
man
.
not
in
a
case
of
poisoning
.
mrs
.
cavendish
s
clear
voice
startled
me
.
dr
.
bauerstein
was
saying
yesterday
that
,
owing
to
the
general
ignorance
of
the
more
uncommon
poisons
among
the
medical
profession
,
there
were
probably
countless
cases
of
poisoning
quite
unsuspected
.
why
,
mary
,
what
a
gruesome
conversation
!
cried
mrs
.
inglethorp
.
it
makes
me
feel
as
if
a
goose
were
walking
over
my
grave
.
oh
,
there
s
cynthia
!
a
young
girl
in
v
.a
.d
.
uniform
ran
lightly
across
the
lawn
.
why
,
cynthia
,
you
are
late
to
day
.
this
is
mr
.
hastings
miss
murdoch
.
cynthia
murdoch
was
a
fresh
looking
young
creature
,
full
of
life
and
vigour
.
she
tossed
off
her
little
v
.a
.d
.
cap
,
and
i
admired
the
great
loose
waves
of
her
auburn
hair
,
and
the
smallness
and
whiteness
of
the
hand
she
held
out
to
claim
her
tea
.
with
dark
eyes
and
eyelashes
she
would
have
been
a
beauty
.
she
flung
herself
down
on
the
ground
beside
john
,
and
as
i
handed
her
a
plate
of
sandwiches
she
smiled
up
at
me
.
sit
down
here
on
the
grass
,
do
.
it
s
ever
so
much
nicer
.
i
dropped
down
obediently
.
you
work
at
tadminster
,
don
t
you
,
miss
murdoch
?
she
nodded
.
for
my
sins
.
do
they
bully
you
,
then
?
i
asked
,
smiling
.
i
should
like
to
see
them
!
cried
cynthia
with
dignity
.
i
have
got
a
cousin
who
is
nursing
,
i
remarked
.
and
she
is
terrified
of
sisters
.
i
don
t
wonder
.
sisters
are
,
you
know
,
mr
.
hastings
.
they
simp
ly
are
!
you
ve
no
idea
!
but
i
m
not
a
nurse
,
thank
heaven
,
i
work
in
the
dispensary
.
how
many
people
do
you
poison
?
i
asked
,
smiling
.
cynthia
smiled
too
.
oh
,
hundreds
!
she
said
.
cynthia
,
called
mrs
.
inglethorp
,
do
you
think
you
could
write
a
few
notes
for
me
?
certainly
,
aunt
emily
.
she
jumped
up
promptly
,
and
something
in
her
manner
reminded
me
that
her
position
was
a
dependent
one
,
and
that
mrs
.
inglethorp
,
kind
as
she
might
be
in
the
main
,
did
not
allow
her
to
forget
it
.
my
hostess
turned
to
me
.
john
will
show
you
your
room
.
supper
is
at
half
past
seven
.
we
have
given
up
late
dinner
for
some
time
now
.
lady
tadminster
,
our
member
s
wife
she
was
the
late
lord
abbotsbury
s
daughter
does
the
same
.
she
agrees
with
me
that
one
must
set
an
example
of
economy
.
we
are
quite
a
war
household
nothing
is
wasted
here
every
scrap
of
waste
paper
,
even
,
is
saved
and
sent
away
in
sacks
.
i
expressed
my
appreciation
,
and
john
took
me
into
the
house
and
up
the
broad
staircase
,
which
forked
right
and
left
half
way
to
different
wings
of
the
building
.
my
room
was
in
the
left
wing
,
and
looked
out
over
the
park
.
john
left
me
,
and
a
few
minutes
later
i
saw
him
from
my
window
walking
slowly
across
the
grass
arm
in
arm
with
cynthia
murdoch
.
i
heard
mrs
.
inglethorp
call
cynthia
impatiently
,
and
the
girl
started
and
ran
back
to
the
house
.
at
the
same
moment
,
a
man
stepped
out
from
the
shadow
of
a
tree
and
walked
slowly
in
the
same
direction
.
he
looked
about
forty
,
very
dark
with
a
melancholy
clean
shaven
face
.
some
violent
emotion
seemed
to
be
mastering
him
.
he
looked
up
at
my
window
as
he
passed
,
and
i
recognized
him
,
though
he
had
changed
much
in
the
fifteen
years
that
had
elapsed
since
we
last
met
.
it
was
john
s
younger
brother
,
lawrence
cavendish
.
i
wondered
what
it
was
that
had
brought
that
singular
expression
to
his
face
.
then
i
dismissed
him
from
my
mind
,
and
returned
to
the
contemplation
of
my
own
affairs
.
the
evening
passed
pleasantly
enough
and
i
dreamed
that
night
of
that
enigmatical
woman
,
mary
cavendish
.
the
next
morning
dawned
bright
and
sunny
,
and
i
was
full
of
the
anticipation
of
a
delightful
visit
.
i
did
not
see
mrs
.
cavendish
until
lunch
time
,
when
she
volunteered
to
take
me
for
a
walk
,
and
we
spent
a
charming
afternoon
roaming
in
the
woods
,
returning
to
the
house
about
five
.
as
we
entered
the
large
hall
,
john
beckoned
us
both
into
the
smoking
room
.
i
saw
at
once
by
his
face
that
something
disturbing
had
occurred
.
we
followed
him
in
,
and
he
shut
the
door
after
us
.
look
here
,
mary
,
there
s
the
deuce
of
a
mess
.
evie
s
had
a
row
with
alfred
inglethorp
,
and
she
s
off
.
evie
?
off
?
john
nodded
gloomily
.
yes
you
see
she
went
to
the
mater
,
and
oh
,
here
s
evie
herself
.
miss
howard
entered
.
her
lips
were
set
grimly
together
,
and
she
carried
a
small
suit
case
.
she
looked
excited
and
determined
,
and
slightly
on
the
defensive
.
at
any
rate
,
she
burst
out
,
i
ve
spoken
my
mind
!
my
dear
evelyn
,
cried
mrs
.
cavendish
,
this
can
t
be
true
!
miss
howard
nodded
grimly
.
true
enough
!
afraid
i
said
some
things
to
emily
she
won
t
forget
or
forgive
in
a
hurry
.
don
t
mind
if
they
ve
only
sunk
in
a
bit
.
probably
water
off
a
duck
s
back
,
though
.
i
said
right
out
you
re
an
old
woman
,
emily
,
and
there
s
no
fool
like
an
old
fool
.
the
man
s
twenty
years
younger
than
you
,
and
don
t
you
fool
yourself
as
to
what
he
married
you
for
.
money
!
well
,
don
t
let
him
have
too
much
of
it
.
farmer
raikes
has
got
a
very
pretty
young
wife
.
just
ask
your
alfred
how
much
time
he
spends
over
there
.
she
was
very
angry
.
natural
!
i
went
on
,
i
m
going
to
warn
you
,
whether
you
like
it
or
not
.
that
man
would
as
soon
murder
you
in
your
bed
as
look
at
you
.
he
s
a
bad
lot
.
you
can
say
what
you
like
to
me
,
but
remember
what
i
ve
told
you
.
he
s
a
bad
lot
!
what
did
she
say
?
miss
howard
made
an
extremely
expressive
grimace
.
darling
alfred
dearest
alfred
wicked
calumnies
wicked
lies
wicked
woman
to
accuse
her
dear
husband
!
the
sooner
i
left
her
house
the
better
.
so
i
m
off
.
but
not
now
?
this
minute
!
for
a
moment
we
sat
and
stared
at
her
.
finally
john
cavendish
,
finding
his
persuasions
of
no
avail
,
went
off
to
look
up
the
trains
.
his
wife
followed
him
,
murmuring
something
about
persuading
mrs
.
inglethorp
to
think
better
of
it
.
as
she
left
the
room
,
miss
howard
s
face
changed
.
she
leant
towards
me
eagerly
.
mr
.
hastings
,
you
re
honest
.
i
can
trust
you
?
i
was
a
little
startled
.
she
laid
her
hand
on
my
arm
,
and
sank
her
voice
to
a
whisper
.
look
after
her
,
mr
.
hastings
.
my
poor
emily
.
they
re
a
lot
of
sharks
all
of
them
.
oh
,
i
know
what
i
m
talking
about
.
there
isn
t
one
of
them
that
s
not
hard
up
and
trying
to
get
money
out
of
her
.
i
ve
protected
her
as
much
as
i
could
.
now
i
m
out
of
the
way
,
they
ll
impose
upon
her
.
of
course
,
miss
howard
,
i
said
,
i
ll
do
everything
i
can
,
but
i
m
sure
you
re
excited
and
overwrought
.
she
interrupted
me
by
slowly
shaking
her
forefinger
.
young
man
,
trust
me
.
i
ve
lived
in
the
world
rather
longer
than
you
have
.
all
i
ask
you
is
to
keep
your
eyes
open
.
you
ll
see
what
i
mean
.
the
throb
of
the
motor
came
through
the
open
window
,
and
miss
howard
rose
and
moved
to
the
door
.
john
s
voice
sounded
outside
.
with
her
hand
on
the
handle
,
she
turned
her
head
over
her
shoulder
,
and
beckoned
to
me
.
above
all
,
mr
.
hastings
,
watch
that
devil
her
husband
!
there
was
no
time
for
more
.
miss
howard
was
swallowed
up
in
an
eager
chorus
of
protests
and
good
byes
.
the
inglethorps
did
not
appear
.
as
the
motor
drove
away
,
mrs
.
cavendish
suddenly
detached
herself
from
the
group
,
and
moved
across
the
drive
to
the
lawn
to
meet
a
tall
bearded
man
who
had
been
evidently
making
for
the
house
.
the
colour
rose
in
her
cheeks
as
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
.
who
is
that
?
i
asked
sharply
,
for
instinctively
i
distrusted
the
man
.
that
s
dr
.
bauerstein
,
said
john
shortly
.
and
who
is
dr
.
bauerstein
?
he
s
staying
in
the
village
doing
a
rest
cure
,
after
a
bad
nervous
breakdown
.
he
s
a
london
specialist
a
very
clever
man
one
of
the
greatest
living
experts
on
poisons
,
i
believe
.
and
he
s
a
great
friend
of
mary
s
,
put
in
cynthia
,
the
irrepressible
.
john
cavendish
frowned
and
changed
the
subject
.
come
for
a
stroll
,
hastings
.
this
has
been
a
most
rotten
business
.
she
always
had
a
rough
tongue
,
but
there
is
no
stauncher
friend
in
england
than
evelyn
howard
.
he
took
the
path
through
the
plantation
,
and
we
walked
down
to
the
village
through
the
woods
which
bordered
one
side
of
the
estate
.
as
we
passed
through
one
of
the
gates
on
our
way
home
again
,
a
pretty
young
woman
of
gipsy
type
coming
in
the
opposite
direction
bowed
and
smiled
.
that
s
a
pretty
girl
,
i
remarked
appreciatively
.
john
s
face
hardened
.
that
is
mrs
.
raikes
.
the
one
that
miss
howard
exactly
,
said
john
,
with
rather
unnecessary
abruptness
.
i
thought
of
the
white
haired
old
lady
in
the
big
house
,
and
that
vivid
wicked
little
face
that
had
just
smiled
into
ours
,
and
a
vague
chill
of
foreboding
crept
over
me
.
i
brushed
it
aside
.
styles
is
really
a
glorious
old
place
,
i
said
to
john
.
he
nodded
rather
gloomily
.
yes
,
it
s
a
fine
property
.
it
ll
be
mine
some
day
should
be
mine
now
by
rights
,
if
my
father
had
only
made
a
decent
will
.
and
then
i
shouldn
t
be
so
damned
hard
up
as
i
am
now
.
hard
up
,
are
you
?
my
dear
hastings
,
i
don
t
mind
telling
you
that
i
m
at
my
wits
end
for
money
.
couldn
t
your
brother
help
you
?
lawrence
?
he
s
gone
through
every
penny
he
ever
had
,
publishing
rotten
verses
in
fancy
bindings
.
no
,
we
re
an
impecunious
lot
.
my
mother
s
always
been
awfully
good
to
us
,
i
must
say
.
that
is
,
up
to
now
.
since
her
marriage
,
of
course
he
broke
off
,
frowning
.
for
the
first
time
i
felt
that
,
with
evelyn
howard
,
something
indefinable
had
gone
from
the
atmosphere
.
her
presence
had
spelt
security
.
now
that
security
was
removed
and
the
air
seemed
rife
with
suspicion
.
the
sinister
face
of
dr
.
bauerstein
recurred
to
me
unpleasantly
.
a
vague
suspicion
of
everyone
and
everything
filled
my
mind
.
just
for
a
moment
i
had
a
premonition
of
approaching
evil
.
chapter
ii
.
the
th
and
th
of
july
i
had
arrived
at
styles
on
the
th
of
july
.
i
come
now
to
the
events
of
the
th
and
th
of
that
month
.
for
the
convenience
of
the
reader
i
will
recapitulate
the
incidents
of
those
days
in
as
exact
a
manner
as
possible
.
they
were
elicited
subsequently
at
the
trial
by
a
process
of
long
and
tedious
cross
examinations
.
i
received
a
letter
from
evelyn
howard
a
couple
of
days
after
her
departure
,
telling
me
she
was
working
as
a
nurse
at
the
big
hospital
in
middlingham
,
a
manufacturing
town
some
fifteen
miles
away
,
and
begging
me
to
let
her
know
if
mrs
.
inglethorp
should
show
any
wish
to
be
reconciled
.
the
only
fly
in
the
ointment
of
my
peaceful
days
was
mrs
.
cavendish
s
extraordinary
,
and
,
for
my
part
,
unaccountable
preference
for
the
society
of
dr
.
bauerstein
.
what
she
saw
in
the
man
i
cannot
imagine
,
but
she
was
always
asking
him
up
to
the
house
,
and
often
went
off
for
long
expeditions
with
him
.
i
must
confess
that
i
was
quite
unable
to
see
his
attraction
.
the
th
of
july
fell
on
a
monday
.
it
was
a
day
of
turmoil
.
the
famous
bazaar
had
taken
place
on
saturday
,
and
an
entertainment
,
in
connection
with
the
same
charity
,
at
which
mrs
.
inglethorp
was
to
recite
a
war
poem
,
was
to
be
held
that
night
.
we
were
all
busy
during
the
morning
arranging
and
decorating
the
hall
in
the
village
where
it
was
to
take
place
.
we
had
a
late
luncheon
and
spent
the
afternoon
resting
in
the
garden
.
i
noticed
that
john
s
manner
was
somewhat
unusual
.
he
seemed
very
excited
and
restless
.
after
tea
,
mrs
.
inglethorp
went
to
lie
down
to
rest
before
her
efforts
in
the
evening
and
i
challenged
mary
cavendish
to
a
single
at
tennis
.
about
a
quarter
to
seven
,
mrs
.
inglethorp
called
us
that
we
should
be
late
as
supper
was
early
that
night
.
we
had
rather
a
scramble
to
get
ready
in
time
and
before
the
meal
was
over
the
motor
was
waiting
at
the
door
.
the
entertainment
was
a
great
success
,
mrs
.
inglethorp
s
recitation
receiving
tremendous
applause
.
there
were
also
some
tableaux
in
which
cynthia
took
part
.
she
did
not
return
with
us
,
having
been
asked
to
a
supper
party
,
and
to
remain
the
night
with
some
friends
who
had
been
acting
with
her
in
the
tableaux
.
the
following
morning
,
mrs
.
inglethorp
stayed
in
bed
to
breakfast
,
as
she
was
rather
overtired
but
she
appeared
in
her
briskest
mood
about
.
,
and
swept
lawrence
and
myself
off
to
a
luncheon
party
.
such
a
charming
invitation
from
mrs
.
rolleston
.
lady
tadminster
s
sister
,
you
know
.
the
rollestons
came
over
with
the
conqueror
one
of
our
oldest
families
.
mary
had
excused
herself
on
the
plea
of
an
engagement
with
dr
.
bauerstein
.
we
had
a
pleasant
luncheon
,
and
as
we
drove
away
lawrence
suggested
that
we
should
return
by
tadminster
,
which
was
barely
a
mile
out
of
our
way
,
and
pay
a
visit
to
cynthia
in
her
dispensary
.
mrs
.
inglethorp
replied
that
this
was
an
excellent
idea
,
but
as
she
had
several
letters
to
write
she
would
drop
us
there
,
and
we
could
come
back
with
cynthia
in
the
pony
trap
.
we
were
detained
under
suspicion
by
the
hospital
porter
,
until
cynthia
appeared
to
vouch
for
us
,
looking
very
cool
and
sweet
in
her
long
white
overall
.
she
took
us
up
to
her
sanctum
,
and
introduced
us
to
her
fellow
dispenser
,
a
rather
awe
inspiring
individual
,
whom
cynthia
cheerily
addressed
as
nibs
.
what
a
lot
of
bottles
!
i
exclaimed
,
as
my
eye
travelled
round
the
small
room
.
do
you
really
know
what
s
in
them
all
?
say
something
original
,
groaned
cynthia
.
every
single
person
who
comes
up
here
says
that
.
we
are
really
thinking
of
bestowing
a
prize
on
the
first
individual
who
does
not
say
what
a
lot
of
bottles
!
and
i
know
the
next
thing
you
re
going
to
say
is
how
many
people
have
you
poisoned
?
i
pleaded
guilty
with
a
laugh
.
if
you
people
only
knew
how
fatally
easy
it
is
to
poison
someone
by
mistake
,
you
wouldn
t
joke
about
it
.
come
on
,
let
s
have
tea
.
we
ve
got
all
sorts
of
secret
stories
in
that
cupboard
.
no
,
lawrence
that
s
the
poison
cupboard
.
the
big
cupboard
that
s
right
.
we
had
a
very
cheery
tea
,
and
assisted
cynthia
to
wash
up
afterwards
.
we
had
just
put
away
the
last
tea
spoon
when
a
knock
came
at
the
door
.
the
countenances
of
cynthia
and
nibs
were
suddenly
petrified
into
a
stern
and
forbidding
expression
.
come
in
,
said
cynthia
,
in
a
sharp
professional
tone
.
a
young
and
rather
scared
looking
nurse
appeared
with
a
bottle
which
she
proffered
to
nibs
,
who
waved
her
towards
cynthia
with
the
somewhat
enigmatical
remark
i
m
not
really
here
to
day
.
cynthia
took
the
bottle
and
examined
it
with
the
severity
of
a
judge
.
this
should
have
been
sent
up
this
morning
.
sister
is
very
sorry
.
she
forgot
.
sister
should
read
the
rules
outside
the
door
.
i
gathered
from
the
little
nurse
s
expression
that
there
was
not
the
least
likelihood
of
her
having
the
hardihood
to
retail
this
message
to
the
dreaded
sister
.
so
now
it
can
t
be
done
until
to
morrow
,
finished
cynthia
.
don
t
you
think
you
could
possibly
let
us
have
it
to
night
?
well
,
said
cynthia
graciously
,
we
are
very
busy
,
but
if
we
have
time
it
shall
be
done
.
the
little
nurse
withdrew
,
and
cynthia
promptly
took
a
jar
from
the
shelf
,
refilled
the
bottle
,
and
placed
it
on
the
table
outside
the
door
.
i
laughed
.
discipline
must
be
maintained
?
exactly
.
come
out
on
our
little
balcony
.
you
can
see
all
the
outside
wards
there
.
i
followed
cynthia
and
her
friend
and
they
pointed
out
the
different
wards
to
me
.
lawrence
remained
behind
,
but
after
a
few
moments
cynthia
called
to
him
over
her
shoulder
to
come
and
join
us
.
then
she
looked
at
her
watch
.
nothing
more
to
do
,
nibs
?
no
.
all
right
.
then
we
can
lock
up
and
go
.
i
had
seen
lawrence
in
quite
a
different
light
that
afternoon
.
compared
to
john
,
he
was
an
astoundingly
difficult
person
to
get
to
know
.
he
was
the
opposite
of
his
brother
in
almost
every
respect
,
being
unusually
shy
and
reserved
.
yet
he
had
a
certain
charm
of
manner
,
and
i
fancied
that
,
if
one
really
knew
him
well
,
one
could
have
a
deep
affection
for
him
.
i
had
always
fancied
that
his
manner
to
cynthia
was
rather
constrained
,
and
that
she
on
her
side
was
inclined
to
be
shy
of
him
.
but
they
were
both
gay
enough
this
afternoon
,
and
chatted
together
like
a
couple
of
children
.
as
we
drove
through
the
village
,
i
remembered
that
i
wanted
some
stamps
,
so
accordingly
we
pulled
up
at
the
post
office
.
as
i
came
out
again
,
i
cannoned
into
a
little
man
who
was
just
entering
.
i
drew
aside
and
apologised
,
when
suddenly
,
with
a
loud
exclamation
,
he
clasped
me
in
his
arms
and
kissed
me
warmly
.
mon
ami
hastings
!
he
cried
.
it
is
indeed
mon
ami
hastings
!
poirot
!
i
exclaimed
.
i
turned
to
the
pony
trap
.
this
is
a
very
pleasant
meeting
for
me
,
miss
cynthia
.
this
is
my
old
friend
,
monsieur
poirot
,
whom
i
have
not
seen
for
years
.
oh
,
we
know
monsieur
poirot
,
said
cynthia
gaily
.
but
i
had
no
idea
he
was
a
friend
of
yours
.
yes
,
indeed
,
said
poirot
seriously
.
i
know
mademoiselle
cynthia
.
it
is
by
the
charity
of
that
good
mrs
.
inglethorp
that
i
am
here
.
then
,
as
i
looked
at
him
inquiringly
yes
,
my
friend
,
she
had
kindly
extended
hospitality
to
seven
of
my
countrypeople
who
,
alas
,
are
refugees
from
their
native
land
.
we
belgians
will
always
remember
her
with
gratitude
.
poirot
was
an
extraordinary
looking
little
man
.
he
was
hardly
more
than
five
feet
,
four
inches
,
but
carried
himself
with
great
dignity
.
his
head
was
exactly
the
shape
of
an
egg
,
and
he
always
perched
it
a
little
on
one
side
.
his
moustache
was
very
stiff
and
military
.
the
neatness
of
his
attire
was
almost
incredible
.
i
believe
a
speck
of
dust
would
have
caused
him
more
pain
than
a
bullet
wound
.
yet
this
quaint
dandified
little
man
who
,
i
was
sorry
to
see
,
now
limped
badly
,
had
been
in
his
time
one
of
the
most
celebrated
members
of
the
belgian
police
.
as
a
detective
,
his
flair
had
been
extraordinary
,
and
he
had
achieved
triumphs
by
unravelling
some
of
the
most
baffling
cases
of
the
day
.
he
pointed
out
to
me
the
little
house
inhabited
by
him
and
his
fellow
belgians
,
and
i
promised
to
go
and
see
him
at
an
early
date
.
then
he
raised
his
hat
with
a
flourish
to
cynthia
,
and
we
drove
away
.
he
s
a
dear
little
man
,
said
cynthia
.
i
d
no
idea
you
knew
him
.
you
ve
been
entertaining
a
celebrity
unawares
,
i
replied
.
and
,
for
the
rest
of
the
way
home
,
i
recited
to
them
the
various
exploits
and
triumphs
of
hercule
poirot
.
we
arrived
back
in
a
very
cheerful
mood
.
as
we
entered
the
hall
,
mrs
.
inglethorp
came
out
of
her
boudoir
.
she
looked
flushed
and
upset
.
oh
,
it
s
you
,
she
said
.
is
there
anything
the
matter
,
aunt
emily
?
asked
cynthia
.
certainly
not
,
said
mrs
.
inglethorp
sharply
.
what
should
there
be
?
then
catching
sight
of
dorcas
,
the
parlourmaid
,
going
into
the
dining
room
,
she
called
to
her
to
bring
some
stamps
into
the
boudoir
.
yes
,
m
m
.
the
old
servant
hesitated
,
then
added
diffidently
don
t
you
think
,
m
m
,
you
d
better
get
to
bed
?
you
re
looking
very
tired
.
perhaps
you
re
right
,
dorcas
yes
no
not
now
.
i
ve
some
letters
i
must
finish
by
post
time
.
have
you
lighted
the
fire
in
my
room
as
i
told
you
?
yes
,
m
m
.
then
i
ll
go
to
bed
directly
after
supper
.
she
went
into
the
boudoir
again
,
and
cynthia
stared
after
her
.
goodness
gracious
!
i
wonder
what
s
up
?
she
said
to
lawrence
.
he
did
not
seem
to
have
heard
her
,
for
without
a
word
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
went
out
of
the
house
.
i
suggested
a
quick
game
of
tennis
before
supper
and
,
cynthia
agreeing
,
i
ran
upstairs
to
fetch
my
racquet
.
mrs
.
cavendish
was
coming
down
the
stairs
.
it
may
have
been
my
fancy
,
but
she
,
too
,
was
looking
odd
and
disturbed
.
had
a
good
walk
with
dr
.
bauerstein
?
i
asked
,
trying
to
appear
as
indifferent
as
i
could
.
i
didn
t
go
,
she
replied
abruptly
.
where
is
mrs
.
inglethorp
?
in
the
boudoir
.
her
hand
clenched
itself
on
the
banisters
,
then
she
seemed
to
nerve
herself
for
some
encounter
,
and
went
rapidly
past
me
down
the
stairs
across
the
hall
to
the
boudoir
,
the
door
of
which
she
shut
behind
her
.
as
i
ran
out
to
the
tennis
court
a
few
moments
later
,
i
had
to
pass
the
open
boudoir
window
,
and
was
unable
to
help
overhearing
the
following
scrap
of
dialogue
.
mary
cavendish
was
saying
in
the
voice
of
a
woman
desperately
controlling
herself
then
you
won
t
show
it
to
me
?
to
which
mrs
.
inglethorp
replied
my
dear
mary
,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
matter
.
then
show
it
to
me
.
i
tell
you
it
is
not
what
you
imagine
.
it
does
not
concern
you
in
the
least
.
to
which
mary
cavendish
replied
,
with
a
rising
bitterness
of
course
,
i
might
have
known
you
would
shield
him
.
cynthia
was
waiting
for
me
,
and
greeted
me
eagerly
with
i
say
!
there
s
been
the
most
awful
row
!
i
ve
got
it
all
out
of
dorcas
.
what
kind
of
a
row
?
between
aunt
emily
and
him
.
i
do
hope
she
s
found
him
out
at
last
!
was
dorcas
there
,
then
?
of
course
not
.
she
happened
to
be
near
the
door
.
it
was
a
real
old
bust
up
.
i
do
wish
i
knew
what
it
was
all
about
.
i
thought
of
mrs
.
raikes
s
gipsy
face
,
and
evelyn
howard
s
warnings
,
but
wisely
decided
to
hold
my
peace
,
whilst
cynthia
exhausted
every
possible
hypothesis
,
and
cheerfully
hoped
,
aunt
emily
will
send
him
away
,
and
will
never
speak
to
him
again
.
i
was
anxious
to
get
hold
of
john
,
but
he
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
.
evidently
something
very
momentous
had
occurred
that
afternoon
.
i
tried
to
forget
the
few
words
i
had
overheard
but
,
do
what
i
would
,
i
could
not
dismiss
them
altogether
from
my
mind
.
what
was
mary
cavendish
s
concern
in
the
matter
?
mr
.
inglethorp
was
in
the
drawing
room
when
i
came
down
to
supper
.
his
face
was
impassive
as
ever
,
and
the
strange
unreality
of
the
man
struck
me
afresh
.
mrs
.
inglethorp
came
down
last
.
she
still
looked
agitated
,
and
during
the
meal
there
was
a
somewhat
constrained
silence
.
inglethorp
was
unusually
quiet
.
as
a
rule
,
he
surrounded
his
wife
with
little
attentions
,
placing
a
cushion
at
her
back
,
and
altogether
playing
the
part
of
the
devoted
husband
.
immediately
after
supper
,
mrs
.
inglethorp
retired
to
her
boudoir
again
.
send
my
coffee
in
here
,
mary
,
she
called
.
i
ve
just
five
minutes
to
catch
the
post
.
cynthia
and
i
went
and
sat
by
the
open
window
in
the
drawing
room
.
mary
cavendish
brought
our
coffee
to
us
.
she
seemed
excited
.
do
you
young
people
want
lights
,
or
do
you
enjoy
the
twilight
?
she
asked
.
will
you
take
mrs
.
inglethorp
her
coffee
,
cynthia
?
i
will
pour
it
out
.
do
not
trouble
,
mary
,
said
inglethorp
.
i
will
take
it
to
emily
.
he
poured
it
out
,
and
went
out
of
the
room
carrying
it
carefully
.
lawrence
followed
him
,
and
mrs
.
cavendish
sat
down
by
us
.
we
three
sat
for
some
time
in
silence
.
it
was
a
glorious
night
,
hot
and
still
.
mrs
.
cavendish
fanned
herself
gently
with
a
palm
leaf
.
it
s
almost
too
hot
,
she
murmured
.
we
shall
have
a
thunderstorm
.
alas
,
that
these
harmonious
moments
can
never
endure
!
my
paradise
was
rudely
shattered
by
the
sound
of
a
well
known
,
and
heartily
disliked
,
voice
in
the
hall
.
dr
.
bauerstein
!
exclaimed
cynthia
.
what
a
funny
time
to
come
.
i
glanced
jealously
at
mary
cavendish
,
but
she
seemed
quite
undisturbed
,
the
delicate
pallor
of
her
cheeks
did
not
vary
.
in
a
few
moments
,
alfred
inglethorp
had
ushered
the
doctor
in
,
the
latter
laughing
,
and
protesting
that
he
was
in
no
fit
state
for
a
drawing
room
.
in
truth
,
he
presented
a
sorry
spectacle
,
being
literally
plastered
with
mud
.
what
have
you
been
doing
,
doctor
?
cried
mrs
.
cavendish
.
i
must
make
my
apologies
,
said
the
doctor
.
i
did
not
really
mean
to
come
in
,
but
mr
.
inglethorp
insisted
.
well
,
bauerstein
,
you
are
in
a
plight
,
said
john
,
strolling
in
from
the
hall
.
have
some
coffee
,
and
tell
us
what
you
have
been
up
to
.
thank
you
,
i
will
.
he
laughed
rather
ruefully
,
as
he
described
how
he
had
discovered
a
very
rare
species
of
fern
in
an
inaccessible
place
,
and
in
his
efforts
to
obtain
it
had
lost
his
footing
,
and
slipped
ignominiously
into
a
neighbouring
pond
.
the
sun
soon
dried
me
off
,
he
added
,
but
i
m
afraid
my
appearance
is
very
disreputable
.
at
this
juncture
,
mrs
.
inglethorp
called
to
cynthia
from
the
hall
,
and
the
girl
ran
out
.
just
carry
up
my
despatch
case
,
will
you
,
dear
?
i
m
going
to
bed
.
the
door
into
the
hall
was
a
wide
one
.
i
had
risen
when
cynthia
did
,
john
was
close
by
me
.
there
were
therefore
three
witnesses
who
could
swear
that
mrs
.
inglethorp
was
carrying
her
coffee
,
as
yet
untasted
,
in
her
hand
.
my
evening
was
utterly
and
entirely
spoilt
by
the
presence
of
dr
.
bauerstein
.
it
seemed
to
me
the
man
would
never
go
.
he
rose
at
last
,
however
,
and
i
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
.
i
ll
walk
down
to
the
village
with
you
,
said
mr
.
inglethorp
.
i
must
see
our
agent
over
those
estate
accounts
.
he
turned
to
john
.
no
one
need
sit
up
.
i
will
take
the
latch
key
.
chapter
iii
.
the
night
of
the
tragedy
to
make
this
part
of
my
story
clear
,
i
append
the
following
plan
of
the
first
floor
of
styles
.
the
servants
rooms
are
reached
through
the
door
b
.
they
have
no
communication
with
the
right
wing
,
where
the
inglethorps
rooms
were
situated
.
it
seemed
to
be
the
middle
of
the
night
when
i
was
awakened
by
lawrence
cavendish
.
he
had
a
candle
in
his
hand
,
and
the
agitation
of
his
face
told
me
at
once
that
something
was
seriously
wrong
.
what
s
the
matter
?
i
asked
,
sitting
up
in
bed
,
and
trying
to
collect
my
scattered
thoughts
.
we
are
afraid
my
mother
is
very
ill
.
she
seems
to
be
having
some
kind
of
fit
.
unfortunately
she
has
locked
herself
in
.
i
ll
come
at
once
.
i
sprang
out
of
bed
and
,
pulling
on
a
dressing
gown
,
followed
lawrence
along
the
passage
and
the
gallery
to
the
right
wing
of
the
house
.
john
cavendish
joined
us
,
and
one
or
two
of
the
servants
were
standing
round
in
a
state
of
awe
stricken
excitement
.
lawrence
turned
to
his
brother
.
what
do
you
think
we
had
better
do
?
never
,
i
thought
,
had
his
indecision
of
character
been
more
apparent
.
john
rattled
the
handle
of
mrs
.
inglethorp
s
door
violently
,
but
with
no
effect
.
it
was
obviously
locked
or
bolted
on
the
inside
.
the
whole
household
was
aroused
by
now
.
the
most
alarming
sounds
were
audible
from
the
interior
of
the
room
.
clearly
something
must
be
done
.
try
going
through
mr
.
inglethorp
s
room
,
sir
,
cried
dorcas
.
oh
,
the
poor
mistress
!
suddenly
i
realized
that
alfred
inglethorp
was
not
with
us
that
he
alone
had
given
no
sign
of
his
presence
.
john
opened
the
door
of
his
room
.
it
was
pitch
dark
,
but
lawrence
was
following
with
the
candle
,
and
by
its
feeble
light
we
saw
that
the
bed
had
not
been
slept
in
,
and
that
there
was
no
sign
of
the
room
having
been
occupied
.
we
went
straight
to
the
connecting
door
.
that
,
too
,
was
locked
or
bolted
on
the
inside
.
what
was
to
be
done
?
oh
,
dear
,
sir
,
cried
dorcas
,
wringing
her
hands
,
what
ever
shall
we
do
?
we
must
try
and
break
the
door
in
,
i
suppose
.
it
ll
be
a
tough
job
,
though
.
here
,
let
one
of
the
maids
go
down
and
wake
baily
and
tell
him
to
go
for
dr
.
wilkins
at
once
.
now
then
,
we
ll
have
a
try
at
the
door
.
half
a
moment
,
though
,
isn
t
there
a
door
into
miss
cynthia
s
rooms
?
yes
,
sir
,
but
that
s
always
bolted
.
it
s
never
been
undone
.
well
,
we
might
just
see
.
he
ran
rapidly
down
the
corridor
to
cynthia
s
room
.
mary
cavendish
was
there
,
shaking
the
girl
who
must
have
been
an
unusually
sound
sleeper
and
trying
to
wake
her
.
in
a
moment
or
two
he
was
back
.
no
good
.
that
s
bolted
too
.
we
must
break
in
the
door
.
i
think
this
one
is
a
shade
less
solid
than
the
one
in
the
passage
.
we
strained
and
heaved
together
.
the
framework
of
the
door
was
solid
,
and
for
a
long
time
it
resisted
our
efforts
,
but
at
last
we
felt
it
give
beneath
our
weight
,
and
finally
,
with
a
resounding
crash
,
it
was
burst
open
.
we
stumbled
in
together
,
lawrence
still
holding
his
candle
.
mrs
.
inglethorp
was
lying
on
the
bed
,
her
whole
form
agitated
by
violent
convulsions
,
in
one
of
which
she
must
have
overturned
the
table
beside
her
.
as
we
entered
,
however
,
her
limbs
relaxed
,
and
she
fell
back
upon
the
pillows
.
john
strode
across
the
room
,
and
lit
the
gas
.
turning
to
annie
,
one
of
the
housemaids
,
he
sent
her
downstairs
to
the
dining
room
for
brandy
.
then
he
went
across
to
his
mother
whilst
i
unbolted
the
door
that
gave
on
the
corridor
.
i
turned
to
lawrence
,
to
suggest
that
i
had
better
leave
them
now
that
there
was
no
further
need
of
my
services
,
but
the
words
were
frozen
on
my
lips
.
never
have
i
seen
such
a
ghastly
look
on
any
man
s
face
.
he
was
white
as
chalk
,
the
candle
he
held
in
his
shaking
hand
was
sputtering
onto
the
carpet
,
and
his
eyes
,
petrified
with
terror
,
or
some
such
kindred
emotion
,
stared
fixedly
over
my
head
at
a
point
on
the
further
wall
.
it
was
as
though
he
had
seen
something
that
turned
him
to
stone
.
i
instinctively
followed
the
direction
of
his
eyes
,
but
i
could
see
nothing
unusual
.
the
still
feebly
flickering
ashes
in
the
grate
,
and
the
row
of
prim
ornaments
on
the
mantelpiece
,
were
surely
harmless
enough
.
the
violence
of
mrs
.
inglethorp
s
attack
seemed
to
be
passing
.
she
was
able
to
speak
in
short
gasps
.
better
now
very
sudden
stupid
of
me
to
lock
myself
in
.
a
shadow
fell
on
the
bed
and
,
looking
up
,
i
saw
mary
cavendish
standing
near
the
door
with
her
arm
around
cynthia
.
she
seemed
to
be
supporting
the
girl
,
who
looked
utterly
dazed
and
unlike
herself
.
her
face
was
heavily
flushed
,
and
she
yawned
repeatedly
.
poor
cynthia
is
quite
frightened
,
said
mrs
.
cavendish
in
a
low
clear
voice
.
she
herself
,
i
noticed
,
was
dressed
in
her
white
land
smock
.
then
it
must
be
later
than
i
thought
.
i
saw
that
a
faint
streak
of
daylight
was
showing
through
the
curtains
of
the
windows
,
and
that
the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
pointed
to
close
upon
five
o
clock
.
a
strangled
cry
from
the
bed
startled
me
.
a
fresh
access
of
pain
seized
the
unfortunate
old
lady
.
the
convulsions
were
of
a
violence
terrible
to
behold
.
everything
was
confusion
.
we
thronged
round
her
,
powerless
to
help
or
alleviate
.
a
final
convulsion
lifted
her
from
the
bed
,
until
she
appeared
to
rest
upon
her
head
and
her
heels
,
with
her
body
arched
in
an
extraordinary
manner
.
in
vain
mary
and
john
tried
to
administer
more
brandy
.
the
moments
flew
.
again
the
body
arched
itself
in
that
peculiar
fashion
.
at
that
moment
,
dr
.
bauerstein
pushed
his
way
authoritatively
into
the
room
.
for
one
instant
he
stopped
dead
,
staring
at
the
figure
on
the
bed
,
and
,
at
the
same
instant
,
mrs
.
inglethorp
cried
out
in
a
strangled
voice
,
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
doctor
alfred
alfred
then
she
fell
back
motionless
on
the
pillows
.
with
a
stride
,
the
doctor
reached
the
bed
,
and
seizing
her
arms
worked
them
energetically
,
applying
what
i
knew
to
be
artificial
respiration
.
he
issued
a
few
short
sharp
orders
to
the
servants
.
an
imperious
wave
of
his
hand
drove
us
all
to
the
door
.
we
watched
him
,
fascinated
,
though
i
think
we
all
knew
in
our
hearts
that
it
was
too
late
,
and
that
nothing
could
be
done
now
.
i
could
see
by
the
expression
on
his
face
that
he
himself
had
little
hope
.
finally
he
abandoned
his
task
,
shaking
his
head
gravely
.
at
that
moment
,
we
heard
footsteps
outside
,
and
dr
.
wilkins
,
mrs
.
inglethorp
s
own
doctor
,
a
portly
,
fussy
little
man
,
came
bustling
in
.
in
a
few
words
dr
.
bauerstein
explained
how
he
had
happened
to
be
passing
the
lodge
gates
as
the
car
came
out
,
and
had
run
up
to
the
house
as
fast
as
he
could
,
whilst
the
car
went
on
to
fetch
dr
.
wilkins
.
with
a
faint
gesture
of
the
hand
,
he
indicated
the
figure
on
the
bed
.
ve
ry
sad
.
ve
ry
sad
,
murmured
dr
.
wilkins
.
poor
dear
lady
.
always
did
far
too
much
far
too
much
against
my
advice
.
i
warned
her
.
her
heart
was
far
from
strong
.
take
it
easy
,
i
said
to
her
,
take
it
easy
.
but
no
her
zeal
for
good
works
was
too
great
.
nature
rebelled
.
na
ture
re
belled
.
dr
.
bauerstein
,
i
noticed
,
was
watching
the
local
doctor
narrowly
.
he
still
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
him
as
he
spoke
.
the
convulsions
were
of
a
peculiar
violence
,
dr
.
wilkins
.
i
am
sorry
you
were
not
here
in
time
to
witness
them
.
they
were
quite
tetanic
in
character
.
ah
!
said
dr
.
wilkins
wisely
.
i
should
like
to
speak
to
you
in
private
,
said
dr
.
bauerstein
.
he
turned
to
john
.
you
do
not
object
?
certainly
not
.
we
all
trooped
out
into
the
corridor
,
leaving
the
two
doctors
alone
,
and
i
heard
the
key
turned
in
the
lock
behind
us
.
we
went
slowly
down
the
stairs
.
i
was
violently
excited
.
i
have
a
certain
talent
for
deduction
,
and
dr
.
bauerstein
s
manner
had
started
a
flock
of
wild
surmises
in
my
mind
.
mary
cavendish
laid
her
hand
upon
my
arm
.
what
is
it
?
why
did
dr
.
bauerstein
seem
so
peculiar
?
i
looked
at
her
.
do
you
know
what
i
think
?
what
?
listen
!
i
looked
round
,
the
others
were
out
of
earshot
.
i
lowered
my
voice
to
a
whisper
.
i
believe
she
has
been
poisoned
!
i
m
certain
dr
.
bauerstein
suspects
it
.
what
?
she
shrank
against
the
wall
,
the
pupils
of
her
eyes
dilating
wildly
.
then
,
with
a
sudden
cry
that
startled
me
,
she
cried
out
no
,
no
not
that
not
that
!
and
breaking
from
me
,
fled
up
the
stairs
.
i
followed
her
,
afraid
that
she
was
going
to
faint
.
i
found
her
leaning
against
the
bannisters
,
deadly
pale
.
she
waved
me
away
impatiently
.
no
,
no
leave
me
.
i
d
rather
be
alone
.
let
me
just
be
quiet
for
a
minute
or
two
.
go
down
to
the
others
.
i
obeyed
her
reluctantly
.
john
and
lawrence
were
in
the
dining
room
.
i
joined
them
.
we
were
all
silent
,
but
i
suppose
i
voiced
the
thoughts
of
us
all
when
i
at
last
broke
it
by
saying
where
is
mr
.
inglethorp
?
john
shook
his
head
.
he
s
not
in
the
house
.
our
eyes
met
.
where
was
alfred
inglethorp
?
his
absence
was
strange
and
inexplicable
.
i
remembered
mrs
.
inglethorp
s
dying
words
.
what
lay
beneath
them
?
what
more
could
she
have
told
us
,
if
she
had
had
time
?
at
last
we
heard
the
doctors
descending
the
stairs
.
dr
.
wilkins
was
looking
important
and
excited
,
and
trying
to
conceal
an
inward
exultation
under
a
manner
of
decorous
calm
.
dr
.
bauerstein
remained
in
the
background
,
his
grave
bearded
face
unchanged
.
dr
.
wilkins
was
the
spokesman
for
the
two
.
he
addressed
himself
to
john
mr
.
cavendish
,
i
should
like
your
consent
to
a
post
mortem
.
is
that
necessary
?
asked
john
gravely
.
a
spasm
of
pain
crossed
his
face
.
absolutely
,
said
dr
.
bauerstein
.
you
mean
by
that
?
that
neither
dr
.
wilkins
nor
myself
could
give
a
death
certificate
under
the
circumstances
.
john
bent
his
head
.
in
that
case
,
i
have
no
alternative
but
to
agree
.
thank
you
,
said
dr
.
wilkins
briskly
.
we
propose
that
it
should
take
place
to
morrow
night
or
rather
to
night
.
and
he
glanced
at
the
daylight
.
under
the
circumstances
,
i
am
afraid
an
inquest
can
hardly
be
avoided
these
formalities
are
necessary
,
but
i
beg
that
you
won
t
distress
yourselves
.
there
was
a
pause
,
and
then
dr
.
bauerstein
drew
two
keys
from
his
pocket
,
and
handed
them
to
john
.
these
are
the
keys
of
the
two
rooms
.
i
have
locked
them
and
,
in
my
opinion
,
they
would
be
better
kept
locked
for
the
present
.
the
doctors
then
departed
.
i
had
been
turning
over
an
idea
in
my
head
,
and
i
felt
that
the
moment
had
now
come
to
broach
it
.
yet
i
was
a
little
chary
of
doing
so
.
john
,
i
knew
,
had
a
horror
of
any
kind
of
publicity
,
and
was
an
easygoing
optimist
,
who
preferred
never
to
meet
trouble
half
way
.
it
might
be
difficult
to
convince
him
of
the
soundness
of
my
plan
.
lawrence
,
on
the
other
hand
,
being
less
conventional
,
and
having
more
imagination
,
i
felt
i
might
count
upon
as
an
ally
.
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
moment
had
come
for
me
to
take
the
lead
.
john
,
i
said
,
i
am
going
to
ask
you
something
.
well
?
you
remember
my
speaking
of
my
friend
poirot
?
the
belgian
who
is
here
?
he
has
been
a
most
famous
detective
.
yes
.
i
want
you
to
let
me
call
him
in
to
investigate
this
matter
.
what
now
?
before
the
post
mortem
?
yes
,
time
is
an
advantage
if
if
there
has
been
foul
play
.
rubbish
!
cried
lawrence
angrily
.
in
my
opinion
the
whole
thing
is
a
mare
s
nest
of
bauerstein
s
!
wilkins
hadn
t
an
idea
of
such
a
thing
,
until
bauerstein
put
it
into
his
head
.
but
,
like
all
specialists
,
bauerstein
s
got
a
bee
in
his
bonnet
.
poisons
are
his
hobby
,
so
of
course
he
sees
them
everywhere
.
i
confess
that
i
was
surprised
by
lawrence
s
attitude
.
he
was
so
seldom
vehement
about
anything
.
john
hesitated
.
i
can
t
feel
as
you
do
,
lawrence
,
he
said
at
last
.
i
m
inclined
to
give
hastings
a
free
hand
,
though
i
should
prefer
to
wait
a
bit
.
we
don
t
want
any
unnecessary
scandal
.
no
,
no
,
i
cried
eagerly
,
you
need
have
no
fear
of
that
.
poirot
is
discretion
itself
.
very
well
,
then
,
have
it
your
own
way
.
i
leave
it
in
your
hands
.
though
,
if
it
is
as
we
suspect
,
it
seems
a
clear
enough
case
.
god
forgive
me
if
i
am
wronging
him
!
i
looked
at
my
watch
.
it
was
six
o
clock
.
i
determined
to
lose
no
time
.
five
minutes
delay
,
however
,
i
allowed
myself
.
i
spent
it
in
ransacking
the
library
until
i
discovered
a
medical
book
which
gave
a
description
of
strychnine
poisoning
.
chapter
iv
.
poirot
investigates
the
house
which
the
belgians
occupied
in
the
village
was
quite
close
to
the
park
gates
.
one
could
save
time
by
taking
a
narrow
path
through
the
long
grass
,
which
cut
off
the
detours
of
the
winding
drive
.
so
i
,
accordingly
,
went
that
way
.
i
had
nearly
reached
the
lodge
,
when
my
attention
was
arrested
by
the
running
figure
of
a
man
approaching
me
.
it
was
mr
.
inglethorp
.
where
had
he
been
?
how
did
he
intend
to
explain
his
absence
?
he
accosted
me
eagerly
.
my
god
!
this
is
terrible
!
my
poor
wife
!
i
have
only
just
heard
.
where
have
you
been
?
i
asked
.
denby
kept
me
late
last
night
.
it
was
one
o
clock
before
we
d
finished
.
then
i
found
that
i
d
forgotten
the
latch
key
after
all
.
i
didn
t
want
to
arouse
the
household
,
so
denby
gave
me
a
bed
.
how
did
you
hear
the
news
?
i
asked
.
wilkins
knocked
denby
up
to
tell
him
.
my
poor
emily
!
she
was
so
self
sacrificing
such
a
noble
character
.
she
over
taxed
her
strength
.
a
wave
of
revulsion
swept
over
me
.
what
a
consummate
hypocrite
the
man
was
!
i
must
hurry
on
,
i
said
,
thankful
that
he
did
not
ask
me
whither
i
was
bound
.
in
a
few
minutes
i
was
knocking
at
the
door
of
leastways
cottage
.
getting
no
answer
,
i
repeated
my
summons
impatiently
.
a
window
above
me
was
cautiously
opened
,
and
poirot
himself
looked
out
.
he
gave
an
exclamation
of
surprise
at
seeing
me
.
in
a
few
brief
words
,
i
explained
the
tragedy
that
had
occurred
,
and
that
i
wanted
his
help
.
wait
,
my
friend
,
i
will
let
you
in
,
and
you
shall
recount
to
me
the
affair
whilst
i
dress
.
in
a
few
moments
he
had
unbarred
the
door
,
and
i
followed
him
up
to
his
room
.
there
he
installed
me
in
a
chair
,
and
i
related
the
whole
story
,
keeping
back
nothing
,
and
omitting
no
circumstance
,
however
insignificant
,
whilst
he
himself
made
a
careful
and
deliberate
toilet
.
i
told
him
of
my
awakening
,
of
mrs
.
inglethorp
s
dying
words
,
of
her
husband
s
absence
,
of
the
quarrel
the
day
before
,
of
the
scrap
of
conversation
between
mary
and
her
mother
in
law
that
i
had
overheard
,
of
the
former
quarrel
between
mrs
.
inglethorp
and
evelyn
howard
,
and
of
the
latter
s
innuendoes
.
i
was
hardly
as
clear
as
i
could
wish
.
i
repeated
myself
several
times
,
and
occasionally
had
to
go
back
to
some
detail
that
i
had
forgotten
.
poirot
smiled
kindly
on
me
.
the
mind
is
confused
?
is
it
not
so
?
take
time
,
mon
ami
.
you
are
agitated
you
are
excited
it
is
but
natural
.
presently
,
when
we
are
calmer
,
we
will
arrange
the
facts
,
neatly
,
each
in
his
proper
place
.
we
will
examine
and
reject
.
those
of
importance
we
will
put
on
one
side
those
of
no
importance
,
pouf
!
he
screwed
up
his
cherub
like
face
,
and
puffed
comically
enough
blow
them
away
!
that
s
all
very
well
,
i
objected
,
but
how
are
you
going
to
decide
what
is
important
,
and
what
isn
t
?
that
always
seems
the
difficulty
to
me
.
poirot
shook
his
head
energetically
.
he
was
now
arranging
his
moustache
with
exquisite
care
.
not
so
.
voyons
!
one
fact
leads
to
another
so
we
continue
.
does
the
next
fit
in
with
that
?
a
merveille
!
good
!
we
can
proceed
.
this
next
little
fact
no
!
ah
,
that
is
curious
!
there
is
something
missing
a
link
in
the
chain
that
is
not
there
.
we
examine
.
we
search
.
and
that
little
curious
fact
,
that
possibly
paltry
little
detail
that
will
not
tally
,
we
put
it
here
!
he
made
an
extravagant
gesture
with
his
hand
.
it
is
significant
!
it
is
tremendous
!
y
es
ah
!
poirot
shook
his
forefinger
so
fiercely
at
me
that
i
quailed
before
it
.
beware
!
peril
to
the
detective
who
says
it
is
so
small
it
does
not
matter
.
it
will
not
agree
.
i
will
forget
it
.
that
way
lies
confusion
!
everything
matters
.
i
know
.
you
always
told
me
that
.
that
s
why
i
have
gone
into
all
the
details
of
this
thing
whether
they
seemed
to
me
relevant
or
not
.
and
i
am
pleased
with
you
.
you
have
a
good
memory
,
and
you
have
given
me
the
facts
faithfully
.
of
the
order
in
which
you
present
them
,
i
say
nothing
truly
,
it
is
deplorable
!
but
i
make
allowances
you
are
upset
.
to
that
i
attribute
the
circumstance
that
you
have
omitted
one
fact
of
paramount
importance
.
what
is
that
?
i
asked
.
you
have
not
told
me
if
mrs
.
inglethorp
ate
well
last
night
.
i
stared
at
him
.
surely
the
war
had
affected
the
little
man
s
brain
.
he
was
carefully
engaged
in
brushing
his
coat
before
putting
it
on
,
and
seemed
wholly
engrossed
in
the
task
.
i
don
t
remember
,
i
said
.
and
,
anyway
,
i
don
t
see
you
do
not
see
?
but
it
is
of
the
first
importance
.
i
can
t
see
why
,
i
said
,
rather
nettled
.
as
far
as
i
can
remember
,
she
didn
t
eat
much
.
she
was
obviously
upset
,
and
it
had
taken
her
appetite
away
.
that
was
only
natural
.
yes
,
said
poirot
thoughtfully
,
it
was
only
natural
.
he
opened
a
drawer
,
and
took
out
a
small
despatch
case
,
then
turned
to
me
.
now
i
am
ready
.
we
will
proceed
to
the
ch
teau
,
and
study
matters
on
the
spot
.
excuse
me
,
mon
ami
,
you
dressed
in
haste
,
and
your
tie
is
on
one
side
.
permit
me
.
with
a
deft
gesture
,
he
rearranged
it
.
a
y
est
!
now
,
shall
we
start
?
we
hurried
up
the
village
,
and
turned
in
at
the
lodge
gates
.
poirot
stopped
for
a
moment
,
and
gazed
sorrowfully
over
the
beautiful
expanse
of
park
,
still
glittering
with
morning
dew
.
so
beautiful
,
so
beautiful
,
and
yet
,
the
poor
family
,
plunged
in
sorrow
,
prostrated
with
grief
.
he
looked
at
me
keenly
as
he
spoke
,
and
i
was
aware
that
i
reddened
under
his
prolonged
gaze
.
was
the
family
prostrated
by
grief
?
was
the
sorrow
at
mrs
.
inglethorp
s
death
so
great
?
i
realized
that
there
was
an
emotional
lack
in
the
atmosphere
.
the
dead
woman
had
not
the
gift
of
commanding
love
.
her
death
was
a
shock
and
a
distress
,
but
she
would
not
be
passionately
regretted
.
poirot
seemed
to
follow
my
thoughts
.
he
nodded
his
head
gravely
.
no
,
you
are
right
,
he
said
,
it
is
not
as
though
there
was
a
blood
tie
.
she
has
been
kind
and
generous
to
these
cavendishes
,
but
she
was
not
their
own
mother
.
blood
tells
always
remember
that
blood
tells
.
poirot
,
i
said
,
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
why
you
wanted
to
know
if
mrs
.
inglethorp
ate
well
last
night
?
i
have
been
turning
it
over
in
my
mind
,
but
i
can
t
see
how
it
has
anything
to
do
with
the
matter
?
he
was
silent
for
a
minute
or
two
as
we
walked
along
,
but
finally
he
said
i
do
not
mind
telling
you
though
,
as
you
know
,
it
is
not
my
habit
to
explain
until
the
end
is
reached
.
the
present
contention
is
that
mrs
.
inglethorp
died
of
strychnine
poisoning
,
presumably
administered
in
her
coffee
.
yes
?
well
,
what
time
was
the
coffee
served
?
about
eight
o
clock
.
therefore
she
drank
it
between
then
and
half
past
eight
certainly
not
much
later
.
well
,
strychnine
is
a
fairly
rapid
poison
.
its
effects
would
be
felt
very
soon
,
probably
in
about
an
hour
.
yet
,
in
mrs
.
inglethorp
s
case
,
the
symptoms
do
not
manifest
themselves
until
five
o
clock
the
next
morning
nine
hours
!
but
a
heavy
meal
,
taken
at
about
the
same
time
as
the
poison
,
might
retard
its
effects
,
though
hardly
to
that
extent
.
still
,
it
is
a
possibility
to
be
taken
into
account
.
but
,
according
to
you
,
she
ate
very
little
for
supper
,
and
yet
the
symptoms
do
not
develop
until
early
the
next
morning
!
now
that
is
a
curious
circumstance
,
my
friend
.
something
may
arise
at
the
autopsy
to
explain
it
.
in
the
meantime
,
remember
it
.
as
we
neared
the
house
,
john
came
out
and
met
us
.
his
face
looked
weary
and
haggard
.
this
is
a
very
dreadful
business
,
monsieur
poirot
,
he
said
.
hastings
has
explained
to
you
that
we
are
anxious
for
no
publicity
?
i
comprehend
perfectly
.
you
see
,
it
is
only
suspicion
so
far
.
we
have
nothing
to
go
upon
.
precisely
.
it
is
a
matter
of
precaution
only
.
john
turned
to
me
,
taking
out
his
cigarette
case
,
and
lighting
a
cigarette
as
he
did
so
.
you
know
that
fellow
inglethorp
is
back
?
yes
.
i
met
him
.
john
flung
the
match
into
an
adjacent
flower
bed
,
a
proceeding
which
was
too
much
for
poirot
s
feelings
.
he
retrieved
it
,
and
buried
it
neatly
.
it
s
jolly
difficult
to
know
how
to
treat
him
.
that
difficulty
will
not
exist
long
,
pronounced
poirot
quietly
.
john
looked
puzzled
,
not
quite
understanding
the
portent
of
this
cryptic
saying
.
he
handed
the
two
keys
which
dr
.
bauerstein
had
given
him
to
me
.
show
monsieur
poirot
everything
he
wants
to
see
.
the
rooms
are
locked
?
asked
poirot
.
dr
.
bauerstein
considered
it
advisable
.
poirot
nodded
thoughtfully
.
then
he
is
very
sure
.
well
,
that
simplifies
matters
for
us
.
we
went
up
together
to
the
room
of
the
tragedy
.
for
convenience
i
append
a
plan
of
the
room
and
the
principal
articles
of
furniture
in
it
.
poirot
locked
the
door
on
the
inside
,
and
proceeded
to
a
minute
inspection
of
the
room
.
he
darted
from
one
object
to
the
other
with
the
agility
of
a
grasshopper
.
i
remained
by
the
door
,
fearing
to
obliterate
any
clues
.
poirot
,
however
,
did
not
seem
grateful
to
me
for
my
forbearance
.
what
have
you
,
my
friend
,
he
cried
,
that
you
remain
there
like
how
do
you
say
it
?
ah
,
yes
,
the
stuck
pig
?
i
explained
that
i
was
afraid
of
obliterating
any
foot
marks
.
foot
marks
?
but
what
an
idea
!
there
has
already
been
practically
an
army
in
the
room
!
what
foot
marks
are
we
likely
to
find
?
no
,
come
here
and
aid
me
in
my
search
.
i
will
put
down
my
little
case
until
i
need
it
.
he
did
so
,
on
the
round
table
by
the
window
,
but
it
was
an
ill
advised
proceeding
for
,
the
top
of
it
being
loose
,
it
tilted
up
,
and
precipitated
the
despatch
case
on
the
floor
.
eh
voil
une
table
!
cried
poirot
.
ah
,
my
friend
,
one
may
live
in
a
big
house
and
yet
have
no
comfort
.
after
which
piece
of
moralizing
,
he
resumed
his
search
.
a
small
purple
despatch
case
,
with
a
key
in
the
lock
,
on
the
writing
table
,
engaged
his
attention
for
some
time
.
he
took
out
the
key
from
the
lock
,
and
passed
it
to
me
to
inspect
.
i
saw
nothing
peculiar
,
however
.
it
was
an
ordinary
key
of
the
yale
type
,
with
a
bit
of
twisted
wire
through
the
handle
.
next
,
he
examined
the
framework
of
the
door
we
had
broken
in
,
assuring
himself
that
the
bolt
had
really
been
shot
.
then
he
went
to
the
door
opposite
leading
into
cynthia
s
room
.
that
door
was
also
bolted
,
as
i
had
stated
.
however
,
he
went
to
the
length
of
unbolting
it
,
and
opening
and
shutting
it
several
times
this
he
did
with
the
utmost
precaution
against
making
any
noise
.
suddenly
something
in
the
bolt
itself
seemed
to
rivet
his
attention
.
he
examined
it
carefully
,
and
then
,
nimbly
whipping
out
a
pair
of
small
forceps
from
his
case
,
he
drew
out
some
minute
particle
which
he
carefully
sealed
up
in
a
tiny
envelope
.
on
the
chest
of
drawers
there
was
a
tray
with
a
spirit
lamp
and
a
small
saucepan
on
it
.
a
small
quantity
of
a
dark
fluid
remained
in
the
saucepan
,
and
an
empty
cup
and
saucer
that
had
been
drunk
out
of
stood
near
it
.
i
wondered
how
i
could
have
been
so
unobservant
as
to
overlook
this
.
here
was
a
clue
worth
having
.
poirot
delicately
dipped
his
finger
into
liquid
,
and
tasted
it
gingerly
.
he
made
a
grimace
.
cocoa
with
i
think
rum
in
it
.
he
passed
on
to
the
debris
on
the
floor
,
where
the
table
by
the
bed
had
been
overturned
.
a
reading
lamp
,
some
books
,
matches
,
a
bunch
of
keys
,
and
the
crushed
fragments
of
a
coffee
cup
lay
scattered
about
.
ah
,
this
is
curious
,
said
poirot
.
i
must
confess
that
i
see
nothing
particularly
curious
about
it
.
you
do
not
?
observe
the
lamp
the
chimney
is
broken
in
two
places
they
lie
there
as
they
fell
.
but
see
,
the
coffee
cup
is
absolutely
smashed
to
powder
.
well
,
i
said
wearily
,
i
suppose
someone
must
have
stepped
on
it
.
exactly
,
said
poirot
,
in
an
odd
voice
.
someone
stepped
on
it
.
he
rose
from
his
knees
,
and
walked
slowly
across
to
the
mantelpiece
,
where
he
stood
abstractedly
fingering
the
ornaments
,
and
straightening
them
a
trick
of
his
when
he
was
agitated
.
mon
ami
,
he
said
,
turning
to
me
,
somebody
stepped
on
that
cup
,
grinding
it
to
powder
,
and
the
reason
they
did
so
was
either
because
it
contained
strychnine
or
which
is
far
more
serious
because
it
did
not
contain
strychnine
!
i
made
no
reply
.
i
was
bewildered
,
but
i
knew
that
it
was
no
good
asking
him
to
explain
.
in
a
moment
or
two
he
roused
himself
,
and
went
on
with
his
investigations
.
he
picked
up
the
bunch
of
keys
from
the
floor
,
and
twirling
them
round
in
his
fingers
finally
selected
one
,
very
bright
and
shining
,
which
he
tried
in
the
lock
of
the
purple
despatch
case
.
it
fitted
,
and
he
opened
the
box
,
but
after
a
moment
s
hesitation
,
closed
and
relocked
it
,
and
slipped
the
bunch
of
keys
,
as
well
as
the
key
that
had
originally
stood
in
the
lock
,
into
his
own
pocket
.
i
have
no
authority
to
go
through
these
papers
.
but
it
should
be
done
at
once
!
he
then
made
a
very
careful
examination
of
the
drawers
of
the
wash
stand
.
crossing
the
room
to
the
left
hand
window
,
a
round
stain
,
hardly
visible
on
the
dark
brown
carpet
,
seemed
to
interest
him
particularly
.
he
went
down
on
his
knees
,
examining
it
minutely
even
going
so
far
as
to
smell
it
.
finally
,
he
poured
a
few
drops
of
the
cocoa
into
a
test
tube
,
sealing
it
up
carefully
.
his
next
proceeding
was
to
take
out
a
little
notebook
.
we
have
found
in
this
room
,
he
said
,
writing
busily
,
six
points
of
interest
.
shall
i
enumerate
them
,
or
will
you
?
oh
,
you
,
i
replied
hastily
.
very
well
,
then
.
one
,
a
coffee
cup
that
has
been
ground
into
powder
two
,
a
despatch
case
with
a
key
in
the
lock
three
,
a
stain
on
the
floor
.
that
may
have
been
done
some
time
ago
,
i
interrupted
.
no
,
for
it
is
still
perceptibly
damp
and
smells
of
coffee
.
four
,
a
fragment
of
some
dark
green
fabric
only
a
thread
or
two
,
but
recognizable
.
ah
!
i
cried
.
that
was
what
you
sealed
up
in
the
envelope
.
yes
.
it
may
turn
out
to
be
a
piece
of
one
of
mrs
.
inglethorp
s
own
dresses
,
and
quite
unimportant
.
we
shall
see
.
five
,
this
!
with
a
dramatic
gesture
,
he
pointed
to
a
large
splash
of
candle
grease
on
the
floor
by
the
writing
table
.
it
must
have
been
done
since
yesterday
,
otherwise
a
good
housemaid
would
have
at
once
removed
it
with
blotting
paper
and
a
hot
iron
.
one
of
my
best
hats
once
but
that
is
not
to
the
point
.
it
was
very
likely
done
last
night
.
we
were
very
agitated
.
or
perhaps
mrs
.
inglethorp
herself
dropped
her
candle
.
you
brought
only
one
candle
into
the
room
?
yes
.
lawrence
cavendish
was
carrying
it
.
but
he
was
very
upset
.
he
seemed
to
see
something
over
here
i
indicated
the
mantelpiece
that
absolutely
paralysed
him
.
that
is
interesting
,
said
poirot
quickly
.
yes
,
it
is
suggestive
his
eye
sweeping
the
whole
length
of
the
wall
but
it
was
not
his
candle
that
made
this
great
patch
,
for
you
perceive
that
this
is
white
grease
whereas
monsieur
lawrence
s
candle
,
which
is
still
on
the
dressing
table
,
is
pink
.
on
the
other
hand
,
mrs
.
inglethorp
had
no
candlestick
in
the
room
,
only
a
reading
lamp
.
then
,
i
said
,
what
do
you
deduce
?
to
which
my
friend
only
made
a
rather
irritating
reply
,
urging
me
to
use
my
own
natural
faculties
.
and
the
sixth
point
?
i
asked
.
i
suppose
it
is
the
sample
of
cocoa
.
no
,
said
poirot
thoughtfully
.
i
might
have
included
that
in
the
six
,
but
i
did
not
.
no
,
the
sixth
point
i
will
keep
to
myself
for
the
present
.
he
looked
quickly
round
the
room
.
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
done
here
,
i
think
,
unless
he
stared
earnestly
and
long
at
the
dead
ashes
in
the
grate
.
the
fire
burns
and
it
destroys
.
but
by
chance
there
might
be
let
us
see
!
deftly
,
on
hands
and
knees
,
he
began
to
sort
the
ashes
from
the
grate
into
the
fender
,
handling
them
with
the
greatest
caution
.
suddenly
,
he
gave
a
faint
exclamation
.
the
forceps
,
hastings
!
i
quickly
handed
them
to
him
,
and
with
skill
he
extracted
a
small
piece
of
half
charred
paper
.
there
,
mon
ami
!
he
cried
.
what
do
you
think
of
that
?
i
scrutinized
the
fragment
.
this
is
an
exact
reproduction
of
it
i
was
puzzled
.
it
was
unusually
thick
,
quite
unlike
ordinary
notepaper
.
suddenly
an
idea
struck
me
.
poirot
!
i
cried
.
this
is
a
fragment
of
a
will
!
exactly
.
i
looked
up
at
him
sharply
.
you
are
not
surprised
?
no
,
he
said
gravely
,
i
expected
it
.
i
relinquished
the
piece
of
paper
,
and
watched
him
put
it
away
in
his
case
,
with
the
same
methodical
care
that
he
bestowed
on
everything
.
my
brain
was
in
a
whirl
.
what
was
this
complication
of
a
will
?
who
had
destroyed
it
?
the
person
who
had
left
the
candle
grease
on
the
floor
?
obviously
.
but
how
had
anyone
gained
admission
?
all
the
doors
had
been
bolted
on
the
inside
.
now
,
my
friend
,
said
poirot
briskly
,
we
will
go
.
i
should
like
to
ask
a
few
questions
of
the
parlourmaid
dorcas
,
her
name
is
,
is
it
not
?
we
passed
through
alfred
inglethorp
s
room
,
and
poirot
delayed
long
enough
to
make
a
brief
but
fairly
comprehensive
examination
of
it
.
we
went
out
through
that
door
,
locking
both
it
and
that
of
mrs
.
inglethorp
s
room
as
before
.
i
took
him
down
to
the
boudoir
which
he
had
expressed
a
wish
to
see
,
and
went
myself
in
search
of
dorcas
.
when
i
returned
with
her
,
however
,
the
boudoir
was
empty
.
poirot
,
i
cried
,
where
are
you
?
i
am
here
,
my
friend
.
he
had
stepped
outside
the
french
window
,
and
was
standing
,
apparently
lost
in
admiration
,
before
the
various
shaped
flower
beds
.
admirable
!
he
murmured
.
admirable
!
what
symmetry
!
observe
that
crescent
and
those
diamonds
their
neatness
rejoices
the
eye
.
the
spacing
of
the
plants
,
also
,
is
perfect
.
it
has
been
recently
done
is
it
not
so
?
yes
,
i
believe
they
were
at
it
yesterday
afternoon
.
but
come
in
dorcas
is
here
.
eh
bien
,
eh
bien
!
do
not
grudge
me
a
moment
s
satisfaction
of
the
eye
.
yes
,
but
this
affair
is
more
important
.
and
how
do
you
know
that
these
fine
begonias
are
not
of
equal
importance
?
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
.
there
was
really
no
arguing
with
him
if
he
chose
to
take
that
line
.
you
do
not
agree
?
but
such
things
have
been
.
well
,
we
will
come
in
and
interview
the
brave
dorcas
.
dorcas
was
standing
in
the
boudoir
,
her
hands
folded
in
front
of
her
,
and
her
grey
hair
rose
in
stiff
waves
under
her
white
cap
.
she
was
the
very
model
and
picture
of
a
good
old
fashioned
servant
.
in
her
attitude
towards
poirot
,
she
was
inclined
to
be
suspicious
,
but
he
soon
broke
down
her
defences
.
he
drew
forward
a
chair
.
pray
be
seated
,
mademoiselle
.
thank
you
,
sir
.
you
have
been
with
your
mistress
many
years
,
is
it
not
so
?
ten
years
,
sir
.
that
is
a
long
time
,
and
very
faithful
service
.
you
were
much
attached
to
her
,
were
you
not
?
she
was
a
very
good
mistress
to
me
,
sir
.
then
you
will
not
object
to
answering
a
few
questions
.
i
put
them
to
you
with
mr
.
cavendish
s
full
approval
.
oh
,
certainly
,
sir
.
then
i
will
begin
by
asking
you
about
the
events
of
yesterday
afternoon
.
your
mistress
had
a
quarrel
?
yes
,
sir
.
but
i
don
t
know
that
i
ought
dorcas
hesitated
.
poirot
looked
at
her
keenly
.
my
good
dorcas
,
it
is
necessary
that
i
should
know
every
detail
of
that
quarrel
as
fully
as
possible
.
do
not
think
that
you
are
betraying
your
mistress
s
secrets
.
your
mistress
lies
dead
,
and
it
is
necessary
that
we
should
know
all
if
we
are
to
avenge
her
.
nothing
can
bring
her
back
to
life
,
but
we
do
hope
,
if
there
has
been
foul
play
,
to
bring
the
murderer
to
justice
.
amen
to
that
,
said
dorcas
fiercely
.
and
,
naming
no
names
,
there
s
one
in
this
house
that
none
of
us
could
ever
abide
!
and
an
ill
day
it
was
when
first
he
darkened
the
threshold
.
poirot
waited
for
her
indignation
to
subside
,
and
then
,
resuming
his
business
like
tone
,
he
asked
now
,
as
to
this
quarrel
?
what
is
the
first
you
heard
of
it
?
well
,
sir
,
i
happened
to
be
going
along
the
hall
outside
yesterday
what
time
was
that
?
i
couldn
t
say
exactly
,
sir
,
but
it
wasn
t
tea
time
by
a
long
way
.
perhaps
four
o
clock
or
it
may
have
been
a
bit
later
.
well
,
sir
,
as
i
said
,
i
happened
to
be
passing
along
,
when
i
heard
voices
very
loud
and
angry
in
here
.
i
didn
t
exactly
mean
to
listen
,
but
well
,
there
it
is
.
i
stopped
.
the
door
was
shut
,
but
the
mistress
was
speaking
very
sharp
and
clear
,
and
i
heard
what
she
said
quite
plainly
.
you
have
lied
to
me
,
and
deceived
me
,
she
said
.
i
didn
t
hear
what
mr
.
inglethorp
replied
.
he
spoke
a
good
bit
lower
than
she
did
but
she
answered
how
dare
you
?
i
have
kept
you
and
clothed
you
and
fed
you
!
you
owe
everything
to
me
!
and
this
is
how
you
repay
me
!
by
bringing
disgrace
upon
our
name
!
again
i
didn
t
hear
what
he
said
,
but
she
went
on
nothing
that
you
can
say
will
make
any
difference
.
i
see
my
duty
clearly
.
my
mind
is
made
up
.
you
need
not
think
that
any
fear
of
publicity
,
or
scandal
between
husband
and
wife
will
deter
me
.
then
i
thought
i
heard
them
coming
out
,
so
i
went
off
quickly
.
you
are
sure
it
was
mr
.
inglethorp
s
voice
you
heard
?
oh
,
yes
,
sir
,
whose
else
s
could
it
be
?
well
,
what
happened
next
?
later
,
i
came
back
to
the
hall
but
it
was
all
quiet
.
at
five
o
clock
,
mrs
.
inglethorp
rang
the
bell
and
told
me
to
bring
her
a
cup
of
tea
nothing
to
eat
to
the
boudoir
.
she
was
looking
dreadful
so
white
and
upset
.
dorcas
,
she
says
,
i
ve
had
a
great
shock
.
i
m
sorry
for
that
,
m
m
,
i
says
.
you
ll
feel
better
after
a
nice
hot
cup
of
tea
,
m
m
.
she
had
something
in
her
hand
.
i
don
t
know
if
it
was
a
letter
,
or
just
a
piece
of
paper
,
but
it
had
writing
on
it
,
and
she
kept
staring
at
it
,
almost
as
if
she
couldn
t
believe
what
was
written
there
.
she
whispered
to
herself
,
as
though
she
had
forgotten
i
was
there
these
few
words
and
everything
s
changed
.
and
then
she
says
to
me
never
trust
a
man
,
dorcas
,
they
re
not
worth
it
!
i
hurried
off
,
and
got
her
a
good
strong
cup
of
tea
,
and
she
thanked
me
,
and
said
she
d
feel
better
when
she
d
drunk
it
.
i
don
t
know
what
to
do
,
she
says
.
scandal
between
husband
and
wife
is
a
dreadful
thing
,
dorcas
.
i
d
rather
hush
it
up
if
i
could
.
mrs
.
cavendish
came
in
just
then
,
so
she
didn
t
say
any
more
.
she
still
had
the
letter
,
or
whatever
it
was
,
in
her
hand
?
yes
,
sir
.
what
would
she
be
likely
to
do
with
it
afterwards
?
well
,
i
don
t
know
,
sir
,
i
expect
she
would
lock
it
up
in
that
purple
case
of
hers
.
is
that
where
she
usually
kept
important
papers
?
yes
,
sir
.
she
brought
it
down
with
her
every
morning
,
and
took
it
up
every
night
.
when
did
she
lose
the
key
of
it
?
she
missed
it
yesterday
at
lunch
time
,
sir
,
and
told
me
to
look
carefully
for
it
.
she
was
very
much
put
out
about
it
.
but
she
had
a
duplicate
key
?
oh
,
yes
,
sir
.
dorcas
was
looking
very
curiously
at
him
and
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
so
was
i
.
what
was
all
this
about
a
lost
key
?
poirot
smiled
.
never
mind
,
dorcas
,
it
is
my
business
to
know
things
.
is
this
the
key
that
was
lost
?
he
drew
from
his
pocket
the
key
that
he
had
found
in
the
lock
of
the
despatch
case
upstairs
.
dorcas
s
eyes
looked
as
though
they
would
pop
out
of
her
head
.
that
s
it
,
sir
,
right
enough
.
but
where
did
you
find
it
?
i
looked
everywhere
for
it
.
ah
,
but
you
see
it
was
not
in
the
same
place
yesterday
as
it
was
to
day
.
now
,
to
pass
to
another
subject
,
had
your
mistress
a
dark
green
dress
in
her
wardrobe
?
dorcas
was
rather
startled
by
the
unexpected
question
.
no
,
sir
.
are
you
quite
sure
?
oh
,
yes
,
sir
.
has
anyone
else
in
the
house
got
a
green
dress
?
dorcas
reflected
.
miss
cynthia
has
a
green
evening
dress
.
light
or
dark
green
?
a
light
green
,
sir
a
sort
of
chiffon
,
they
call
it
.
ah
,
that
is
not
what
i
want
.
and
nobody
else
has
anything
green
?
no
,
sir
not
that
i
know
of
.
poirot
s
face
did
not
betray
a
trace
of
whether
he
was
disappointed
or
otherwise
.
he
merely
remarked
good
,
we
will
leave
that
and
pass
on
.
have
you
any
reason
to
believe
that
your
mistress
was
likely
to
take
a
sleeping
powder
last
night
?
not
last
night
,
sir
,
i
know
she
didn
t
.
why
do
you
know
so
positively
?
because
the
box
was
empty
.
she
took
the
last
one
two
days
ago
,
and
she
didn
t
have
any
more
made
up
.
you
are
quite
sure
of
that
?
positive
,
sir
.
then
that
is
cleared
up
!
by
the
way
,
your
mistress
didn
t
ask
you
to
sign
any
paper
yesterday
?
to
sign
a
paper
?
no
,
sir
.
when
mr
.
hastings
and
mr
.
lawrence
came
in
yesterday
evening
,
they
found
your
mistress
busy
writing
letters
.
i
suppose
you
can
give
me
no
idea
to
whom
these
letters
were
addressed
?
i
m
afraid
i
couldn
t
,
sir
.
i
was
out
in
the
evening
.
perhaps
annie
could
tell
you
,
though
she
s
a
careless
girl
.
never
cleared
the
coffee
cups
away
last
night
.
that
s
what
happens
when
i
m
not
here
to
look
after
things
.
poirot
lifted
his
hand
.
since
they
have
been
left
,
dorcas
,
leave
them
a
little
longer
,
i
pray
you
.
i
should
like
to
examine
them
.
very
well
,
sir
.
what
time
did
you
go
out
last
evening
?
about
six
o
clock
,
sir
.
thank
you
,
dorcas
,
that
is
all
i
have
to
ask
you
.
he
rose
and
strolled
to
the
window
.
i
have
been
admiring
these
flower
beds
.
how
many
gardeners
are
employed
here
,
by
the
way
?
only
three
now
,
sir
.
five
,
we
had
,
before
the
war
,
when
it
was
kept
as
a
gentleman
s
place
should
be
.
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
it
then
,
sir
.
a
fair
sight
it
was
.
but
now
there
s
only
old
manning
,
and
young
william
,
and
a
new
fashioned
woman
gardener
in
breeches
and
such
like
.
ah
,
these
are
dreadful
times
!
the
good
times
will
come
again
,
dorcas
.
at
least
,
we
hope
so
.
now
,
will
you
send
annie
to
me
here
?
yes
,
sir
.
thank
you
,
sir
.
how
did
you
know
that
mrs
.
inglethorp
took
sleeping
powders
?
i
asked
,
in
lively
curiosity
,
as
dorcas
left
the
room
.
and
about
the
lost
key
and
the
duplicate
?
one
thing
at
a
time
.
as
to
the
sleeping
powders
,
i
knew
by
this
.
he
suddenly
produced
a
small
cardboard
box
,
such
as
chemists
use
for
powders
.
where
did
you
find
it
?
in
the
wash
stand
drawer
in
mrs
.
inglethorp
s
bedroom
.
it
was
number
six
of
my
catalogue
.
but
i
suppose
,
as
the
last
powder
was
taken
two
days
ago
,
it
is
not
of
much
importance
?
probably
not
,
but
do
you
notice
anything
that
strikes
you
as
peculiar
about
this
box
?
i
examined
it
closely
.
no
,
i
can
t
say
that
i
do
.
look
at
the
label
.
i
read
the
label
carefully
one
powder
to
be
taken
at
bedtime
,
if
required
.
mrs
.
inglethorp
.
no
,
i
see
nothing
unusual
.
not
the
fact
that
there
is
no
chemist
s
name
?
ah
!
i
exclaimed
.
to
be
sure
,
that
is
odd
!
have
you
ever
known
a
chemist
to
send
out
a
box
like
that
,
without
his
printed
name
?
no
,
i
can
t
say
that
i
have
.
i
was
becoming
quite
excited
,
but
poirot
damped
my
ardour
by
remarking
yet
the
explanation
is
quite
simple
.
so
do
not
intrigue
yourself
,
my
friend
.
an
audible
creaking
proclaimed
the
approach
of
annie
,
so
i
had
no
time
to
reply
.
annie
was
a
fine
,
strapping
girl
,
and
was
evidently
labouring
under
intense
excitement
,
mingled
with
a
certain
ghoulish
enjoyment
of
the
tragedy
.
poirot
came
to
the
point
at
once
,
with
a
business
like
briskness
.
i
sent
for
you
,
annie
,
because
i
thought
you
might
be
able
to
tell
me
something
about
the
letters
mrs
.
inglethorp
wrote
last
night
.
how
many
were
there
?
and
can
you
tell
me
any
of
the
names
and
addresses
?
annie
considered
.
there
were
four
letters
,
sir
.
one
was
to
miss
howard
,
and
one
was
to
mr
.
wells
,
the
lawyer
,
and
the
other
two
i
don
t
think
i
remember
,
sir
oh
,
yes
,
one
was
to
ross
s
,
the
caterers
in
tadminster
.
the
other
one
,
i
don
t
remember
.
think
,
urged
poirot
.
annie
racked
her
brains
in
vain
.
i
m
sorry
,
sir
,
but
it
s
clean
gone
.
i
don
t
think
i
can
have
noticed
it
.
it
does
not
matter
,
said
poirot
,
not
betraying
any
sign
of
disappointment
.
now
i
want
to
ask
you
about
something
else
.
there
is
a
saucepan
in
mrs
.
inglethorp
s
room
with
some
cocoa
in
it
.
did
she
have
that
every
night
?
yes
,
sir
,
it
was
put
in
her
room
every
evening
,
and
she
warmed
it
up
in
the
night
whenever
she
fancied
it
.
what
was
it
?
plain
cocoa
?
yes
,
sir
,
made
with
milk
,
with
a
teaspoonful
of
sugar
,
and
two
teaspoonfuls
of
rum
in
it
.
who
took
it
to
her
room
?
i
did
,
sir
.
always
?
yes
,
sir
.
at
what
time
?
when
i
went
to
draw
the
curtains
,
as
a
rule
,
sir
.
did
you
bring
it
straight
up
from
the
kitchen
then
?
no
,
sir
,
you
see
there
s
not
much
room
on
the
gas
stove
,
so
cook
used
to
make
it
early
,
before
putting
the
vegetables
on
for
supper
.
then
i
used
to
bring
it
up
,
and
put
it
on
the
table
by
the
swing
door
,
and
take
it
into
her
room
later
.
the
swing
door
is
in
the
left
wing
,
is
it
not
?
yes
,
sir
.
and
the
table
,
is
it
on
this
side
of
the
door
,
or
on
the
farther
servants
side
?
it
s
this
side
,
sir
.
what
time
did
you
bring
it
up
last
night
?
about
quarter
past
seven
,
i
should
say
,
sir
.
and
when
did
you
take
it
into
mrs
.
inglethorp
s
room
?
when
i
went
to
shut
up
,
sir
.
about
eight
o
clock
.
mrs
.
inglethorp
came
up
to
bed
before
i
d
finished
.
then
,
between
seven
fifteen
and
eight
o
clock
,
the
cocoa
was
standing
on
the
table
in
the
left
wing
?
yes
,
sir
.
annie
had
been
growing
redder
and
redder
in
the
face
,
and
now
she
blurted
out
unexpectedly
and
if
there
was
salt
in
it
,
sir
,
it
wasn
t
me
.
i
never
took
the
salt
near
it
.
what
makes
you
think
there
was
salt
in
it
?
asked
poirot
.
seeing
it
on
the
tray
,
sir
.
you
saw
some
salt
on
the
tray
?
yes
.
coarse
kitchen
salt
,
it
looked
.
i
never
noticed
it
when
i
took
the
tray
up
,
but
when
i
came
to
take
it
into
the
mistress
s
room
i
saw
it
at
once
,
and
i
suppose
i
ought
to
have
taken
it
down
again
,
and
asked
cook
to
make
some
fresh
.
but
i
was
in
a
hurry
,
because
dorcas
was
out
,
and
i
thought
maybe
the
cocoa
itself
was
all
right
,
and
the
salt
had
only
gone
on
the
tray
.
so
i
dusted
it
off
with
my
apron
,
and
took
it
in
.
i
had
the
utmost
difficulty
in
controlling
my
excitement
.
unknown
to
herself
,
annie
had
provided
us
with
an
important
piece
of
evidence
.
how
she
would
have
gaped
if
she
had
realized
that
her
coarse
kitchen
salt
was
strychnine
,
one
of
the
most
deadly
poisons
known
to
mankind
.
i
marvelled
at
poirot
s
calm
.
his
self
control
was
astonishing
.
i
awaited
his
next
question
with
impatience
,
but
it
disappointed
me
.
when
you
went
into
mrs
.
inglethorp
s
room
,
was
the
door
leading
into
miss
cynthia
s
room
bolted
?
oh
!
yes
,
sir
it
always
was
.
it
had
never
been
opened
.
and
the
door
into
mr
.
inglethorp
s
room
?
did
you
notice
if
that
was
bolted
too
?
annie
hesitated
.
i
couldn
t
rightly
say
,
sir
it
was
shut
but
i
couldn
t
say
whether
it
was
bolted
or
not
.
when
you
finally
left
the
room
,
did
mrs
.
inglethorp
bolt
the
door
after
you
?
no
,
sir
,
not
then
,
but
i
expect
she
did
later
.
she
usually
did
lock
it
at
night
.
the
door
into
the
passage
,
that
is
.
did
you
notice
any
candle
grease
on
the
floor
when
you
did
the
room
yesterday
?
candle
grease
?
oh
,
no
,
sir
.
mrs
.
inglethorp
didn
t
have
a
candle
,
only
a
reading
lamp
.
then
,
if
there
had
been
a
large
patch
of
candle
grease
on
the
floor
,
you
think
you
would
have
been
sure
to
have
seen
it
?
yes
,
sir
,
and
i
would
have
taken
it
out
with
a
piece
of
blotting
paper
and
a
hot
iron
.
then
poirot
repeated
the
question
he
had
put
to
dorcas
did
your
mistress
ever
have
a
green
dress
?
no
,
sir
.
nor
a
mantle
,
nor
a
cape
,
nor
a
how
do
you
call
it
?
a
sports
coat
?
not
green
,
sir
.
nor
anyone
else
in
the
house
?
annie
reflected
.
no
,
sir
.
you
are
sure
of
that
?
quite
sure
.
bien
!
that
is
all
i
want
to
know
.
thank
you
very
much
.
with
a
nervous
giggle
,
annie
took
herself
creakingly
out
of
the
room
.
my
pent
up
excitement
burst
forth
.
poirot
,
i
cried
,
i
congratulate
you
!
this
is
a
great
discovery
.
what
is
a
great
discovery
?
why
,
that
it
was
the
cocoa
and
not
the
coffee
that
was
poisoned
.
that
explains
everything
!
of
course
it
did
not
take
effect
until
the
early
morning
,
since
the
cocoa
was
only
drunk
in
the
middle
of
the
night
.
so
you
think
that
the
cocoa
mark
well
what
i
say
,
hastings
,
the
cocoa
contained
strychnine
?
of
course
!
that
salt
on
the
tray
,
what
else
could
it
have
been
?
it
might
have
been
salt
,
replied
poirot
placidly
.
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
.
if
he
was
going
to
take
the
matter
that
way
,
it
was
no
good
arguing
with
him
.
the
idea
crossed
my
mind
,
not
for
the
first
time
,
that
poor
old
poirot
was
growing
old
.
privately
i
thought
it
lucky
that
he
had
associated
with
him
someone
of
a
more
receptive
type
of
mind
.
poirot
was
surveying
me
with
quietly
twinkling
eyes
.
you
are
not
pleased
with
me
,
mon
ami
?
my
dear
poirot
,
i
said
coldly
,
it
is
not
for
me
to
dictate
to
you
.
you
have
a
right
to
your
own
opinion
,
just
as
i
have
to
mine
.
a
most
admirable
sentiment
,
remarked
poirot
,
rising
briskly
to
his
feet
.
now
i
have
finished
with
this
room
.
by
the
way
,
whose
is
the
smaller
desk
in
the
corner
?
mr
.
inglethorp
s
.
ah
!
he
tried
the
roll
top
tentatively
.
locked
.
but
perhaps
one
of
mrs
.
inglethorp
s
keys
would
open
it
.
he
tried
several
,
twisting
and
turning
them
with
a
practiced
hand
,
and
finally
uttering
an
ejaculation
of
satisfaction
.
voil
!
it
is
not
the
key
,
but
it
will
open
it
at
a
pinch
.
he
slid
back
the
roll
top
,
and
ran
a
rapid
eye
over
the
neatly
filed
papers
.
to
my
surprise
,
he
did
not
examine
them
,
merely
remarking
approvingly
as
he
relocked
the
desk
decidedly
,
he
is
a
man
of
method
,
this
mr
.
inglethorp
!
a
man
of
method
was
,
in
poirot
s
estimation
,
the
highest
praise
that
could
be
bestowed
on
any
individual
.
i
felt
that
my
friend
was
not
what
he
had
been
as
he
rambled
on
disconnectedly
there
were
no
stamps
in
his
desk
,
but
there
might
have
been
,
eh
,
mon
ami
?
there
might
have
been
?
yes
his
eyes
wandered
round
the
room
this
boudoir
has
nothing
more
to
tell
us
.
it
did
not
yield
much
.
only
this
.
he
pulled
a
crumpled
envelope
out
of
his
pocket
,
and
tossed
it
over
to
me
.
it
was
rather
a
curious
document
.
a
plain
,
dirty
looking
old
envelope
with
a
few
words
scrawled
across
it
,
apparently
at
random
.
the
following
is
a
facsimile
of
it
.
chapter
v
.
it
isn
t
strychnine
,
is
it
?
where
did
you
find
this
?
i
asked
poirot
,
in
lively
curiosity
.
in
the
waste
paper
basket
.
you
recognise
the
handwriting
?
yes
,
it
is
mrs
.
inglethorp
s
.
but
what
does
it
mean
?
poirot
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
i
cannot
say
but
it
is
suggestive
.
a
wild
idea
flashed
across
me
.
was
it
possible
that
mrs
.
inglethorp
s
mind
was
deranged
?
had
she
some
fantastic
idea
of
demoniacal
possession
?
and
,
if
that
were
so
,
was
it
not
also
possible
that
she
might
have
taken
her
own
life
?
i
was
about
to
expound
these
theories
to
poirot
,
when
his
own
words
distracted
me
.
come
,
he
said
,
now
to
examine
the
coffee
cups
!
my
dear
poirot
!
what
on
earth
is
the
good
of
that
,
now
that
we
know
about
the
cocoa
?
oh
,
l
l
!
that
miserable
cocoa
!
cried
poirot
flippantly
.
he
laughed
with
apparent
enjoyment
,
raising
his
arms
to
heaven
in
mock
despair
,
in
what
i
could
not
but
consider
the
worst
possible
taste
.
and
,
anyway
,
i
said
,
with
increasing
coldness
,
as
mrs
.
inglethorp
took
her
coffee
upstairs
with
her
,
i
do
not
see
what
you
expect
to
find
,
unless
you
consider
it
likely
that
we
shall
discover
a
packet
of
strychnine
on
the
coffee
tray
!
poirot
was
sobered
at
once
.
come
,
come
,
my
friend
,
he
said
,
slipping
his
arms
through
mine
.
ne
vous
f
chez
pas
!
allow
me
to
interest
myself
in
my
coffee
cups
,
and
i
will
respect
your
cocoa
.
there
!
is
it
a
bargain
?
he
was
so
quaintly
humorous
that
i
was
forced
to
laugh
and
we
went
together
to
the
drawing
room
,
where
the
coffee
cups
and
tray
remained
undisturbed
as
we
had
left
them
.
poirot
made
me
recapitulate
the
scene
of
the
night
before
,
listening
very
carefully
,
and
verifying
the
position
of
the
various
cups
.
so
mrs
.
cavendish
stood
by
the
tray
and
poured
out
.
yes
.
then
she
came
across
to
the
window
where
you
sat
with
mademoiselle
cynthia
.
yes
.
here
are
the
three
cups
.
and
the
cup
on
the
mantelpiece
,
half
drunk
,
that
would
be
mr
.
lawrence
cavendish
s
.
and
the
one
on
the
tray
?
john
cavendish
s
.
i
saw
him
put
it
down
there
.
good
.
one
,
two
,
three
,
four
,
five
but
where
,
then
,
is
the
cup
of
mr
.
inglethorp
?
he
does
not
take
coffee
.
then
all
are
accounted
for
.
one
moment
,
my
friend
.
with
infinite
care
,
he
took
a
drop
or
two
from
the
grounds
in
each
cup
,
sealing
them
up
in
separate
test
tubes
,
tasting
each
in
turn
as
he
did
so
.
his
physiognomy
underwent
a
curious
change
.
an
expression
gathered
there
that
i
can
only
describe
as
half
puzzled
,
and
half
relieved
.
bien
!
he
said
at
last
.
it
is
evident
!
i
had
an
idea
but
clearly
i
was
mistaken
.
yes
,
altogether
i
was
mistaken
.
yet
it
is
strange
.
but
no
matter
!
and
,
with
a
characteristic
shrug
,
he
dismissed
whatever
it
was
that
was
worrying
him
from
his
mind
.
i
could
have
told
him
from
the
beginning
that
this
obsession
of
his
over
the
coffee
was
bound
to
end
in
a
blind
alley
,
but
i
restrained
my
tongue
.
after
all
,
though
he
was
old
,
poirot
had
been
a
great
man
in
his
day
.
breakfast
is
ready
,
said
john
cavendish
,
coming
in
from
the
hall
.
you
will
breakfast
with
us
,
monsieur
poirot
?
poirot
acquiesced
.
i
observed
john
.
already
he
was
almost
restored
to
his
normal
self
.
the
shock
of
the
events
of
the
last
night
had
upset
him
temporarily
,
but
his
equable
poise
soon
swung
back
to
the
normal
.
he
was
a
man
of
very
little
imagination
,
in
sharp
contrast
with
his
brother
,
who
had
,
perhaps
,
too
much
.
ever
since
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
,
john
had
been
hard
at
work
,
sending
telegrams
one
of
the
first
had
gone
to
evelyn
howard
writing
notices
for
the
papers
,
and
generally
occupying
himself
with
the
melancholy
duties
that
a
death
entails
.
may
i
ask
how
things
are
proceeding
?
he
said
.
do
your
investigations
point
to
my
mother
having
died
a
natural
death
or
or
must
we
prepare
ourselves
for
the
worst
?
i
think
,
mr
.
cavendish
,
said
poirot
gravely
,
that
you
would
do
well
not
to
buoy
yourself
up
with
any
false
hopes
.
can
you
tell
me
the
views
of
the
other
members
of
the
family
?
my
brother
lawrence
is
convinced
that
we
are
making
a
fuss
over
nothing
.
he
says
that
everything
points
to
its
being
a
simple
case
of
heart
failure
.
he
does
,
does
he
?
that
is
very
interesting
very
interesting
,
murmured
poirot
softly
.
and
mrs
.
cavendish
?
a
faint
cloud
passed
over
john
s
face
.
i
have
not
the
least
idea
what
my
wife
s
views
on
the
subject
are
.
the
answer
brought
a
momentary
stiffness
in
its
train
.
john
broke
the
rather
awkward
silence
by
saying
with
a
slight
effort
i
told
you
,
didn
t
i
,
that
mr
.
inglethorp
has
returned
?
poirot
bent
his
head
.
it
s
an
awkward
position
for
all
of
us
.
of
course
one
has
to
treat
him
as
usual
but
,
hang
it
all
,
one
s
gorge
does
rise
at
sitting
down
to
eat
with
a
possible
murderer
!
poirot
nodded
sympathetically
.
i
quite
understand
.
it
is
a
very
difficult
situation
for
you
,
mr
.
cavendish
.
i
would
like
to
ask
you
one
question
.
mr
.
inglethorp
s
reason
for
not
returning
last
night
was
,
i
believe
,
that
he
had
forgotten
the
latch
key
.
is
not
that
so
?
yes
.
i
suppose
you
are
quite
sure
that
the
latch
key
was
forgotten
that
he
did
not
take
it
after
all
?
i
have
no
idea
.
i
never
thought
of
looking
.
we
always
keep
it
in
the
hall
drawer
.
i
ll
go
and
see
if
it
s
there
now
.
poirot
held
up
his
hand
with
a
faint
smile
.
no
,
no
,
mr
.
cavendish
,
it
is
too
late
now
.
i
am
certain
that
you
would
find
it
.
if
mr
.
inglethorp
did
take
it
,
he
has
had
ample
time
to
replace
it
by
now
.
but
do
you
think
i
think
nothing
.
if
anyone
had
chanced
to
look
this
morning
before
his
return
,
and
seen
it
there
,
it
would
have
been
a
valuable
point
in
his
favour
.
that
is
all
.
john
looked
perplexed
.
do
not
worry
,
said
poirot
smoothly
.
i
assure
you
that
you
need
not
let
it
trouble
you
.
since
you
are
so
kind
,
let
us
go
and
have
some
breakfast
.
everyone
was
assembled
in
the
dining
room
.
under
the
circumstances
,
we
were
naturally
not
a
cheerful
party
.
the
reaction
after
a
shock
is
always
trying
,
and
i
think
we
were
all
suffering
from
it
.
decorum
and
good
breeding
naturally
enjoined
that
our
demeanour
should
be
much
as
usual
,
yet
i
could
not
help
wondering
if
this
self
control
were
really
a
matter
of
great
difficulty
.
there
were
no
red
eyes
,
no
signs
of
secretly
indulged
grief
.
i
felt
that
i
was
right
in
my
opinion
that
dorcas
was
the
person
most
affected
by
the
personal
side
of
the
tragedy
.
i
pass
over
alfred
inglethorp
,
who
acted
the
bereaved
widower
in
a
manner
that
i
felt
to
be
disgusting
in
its
hypocrisy
.
did
he
know
that
we
suspected
him
,
i
wondered
.
surely
he
could
not
be
unaware
of
the
fact
,
conceal
it
as
we
would
.
did
he
feel
some
secret
stirring
of
fear
,
or
was
he
confident
that
his
crime
would
go
unpunished
?
surely
the
suspicion
in
the
atmosphere
must
warn
him
that
he
was
already
a
marked
man
.
but
did
everyone
suspect
him
?
what
about
mrs
.
cavendish
?
i
watched
her
as
she
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
,
graceful
,
composed
,
enigmatic
.
in
her
soft
grey
frock
,
with
white
ruffles
at
the
wrists
falling
over
her
slender
hands
,
she
looked
very
beautiful
.
when
she
chose
,
however
,
her
face
could
be
sphinx
like
in
its
inscrutability
.
she
was
very
silent
,
hardly
opening
her
lips
,
and
yet
in
some
queer
way
i
felt
that
the
great
strength
of
her
personality
was
dominating
us
all
.
and
little
cynthia
?
did
she
suspect
?
she
looked
very
tired
and
ill
,
i
thought
.
the
heaviness
and
languor
of
her
manner
were
very
marked
.
i
asked
her
if
she
were
feeling
ill
,
and
she
answered
frankly
yes
,
i
ve
got
the
most
beastly
headache
.
have
another
cup
of
coffee
,
mademoiselle
?
said
poirot
solicitously
.
it
will
revive
you
.
it
is
unparalleled
for
the
mal
de
t
te
.
he
jumped
up
and
took
her
cup
.
no
sugar
,
said
cynthia
,
watching
him
,
as
he
picked
up
the
sugar
tongs
.
no
sugar
?
you
abandon
it
in
the
war
time
,
eh
?
no
,
i
never
take
it
in
coffee
.
sacr
!
murmured
poirot
to
himself
,
as
he
brought
back
the
replenished
cup
.
only
i
heard
him
,
and
glancing
up
curiously
at
the
little
man
i
saw
that
his
face
was
working
with
suppressed
excitement
,
and
his
eyes
were
as
green
as
a
cat
s
.
he
had
heard
or
seen
something
that
had
affected
him
strongly
but
what
was
it
?
i
do
not
usually
label
myself
as
dense
,
but
i
must
confess
that
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
had
attracted
my
attention
.
in
another
moment
,
the
door
opened
and
dorcas
appeared
.
mr
.
wells
to
see
you
,
sir
,
she
said
to
john
.
i
remembered
the
name
as
being
that
of
the
lawyer
to
whom
mrs
.
inglethorp
had
written
the
night
before
.
john
rose
immediately
.
show
him
into
my
study
.
then
he
turned
to
us
.
my
mother
s
lawyer
,
he
explained
.
and
in
a
lower
voice
he
is
also
coroner
you
understand
.
perhaps
you
would
like
to
come
with
me
?
we
acquiesced
and
followed
him
out
of
the
room
.
john
strode
on
ahead
and
i
took
the
opportunity
of
whispering
to
poirot
there
will
be
an
inquest
then
?
poirot
nodded
absently
.
he
seemed
absorbed
in
thought
so
much
so
that
my
curiosity
was
aroused
.
what
is
it
?
you
are
not
attending
to
what
i
say
.
it
is
true
,
my
friend
.
i
am
much
worried
.
why
?
because
mademoiselle
cynthia
does
not
take
sugar
in
her
coffee
.
what
?
you
cannot
be
serious
?
but
i
am
most
serious
.
ah
,
there
is
something
there
that
i
do
not
understand
.
my
instinct
was
right
.
what
instinct
?
the
instinct
that
led
me
to
insist
on
examining
those
coffee
cups
.
chut
!
no
more
now
!
we
followed
john
into
his
study
,
and
he
closed
the
door
behind
us
.
mr
.
wells
was
a
pleasant
man
of
middle
age
,
with
keen
eyes
,
and
the
typical
lawyer
s
mouth
.
john
introduced
us
both
,
and
explained
the
reason
of
our
presence
.
you
will
understand
,
wells
,
he
added
,
that
this
is
all
strictly
private
.
we
are
still
hoping
that
there
will
turn
out
to
be
no
need
for
investigation
of
any
kind
.
quite
so
,
quite
so
,
said
mr
.
wells
soothingly
.
i
wish
we
could
have
spared
you
the
pain
and
publicity
of
an
inquest
,
but
of
course
it
s
quite
unavoidable
in
the
absence
of
a
doctor
s
certificate
.
yes
,
i
suppose
so
.
clever
man
,
bauerstein
.
great
authority
on
toxicology
,
i
believe
.
indeed
,
said
john
with
a
certain
stiffness
in
his
manner
.
then
he
added
rather
hesitatingly
shall
we
have
to
appear
as
witnesses
all
of
us
,
i
mean
?
you
,
of
course
and
ah
er
mr
.
er
inglethorp
.
a
slight
pause
ensued
before
the
lawyer
went
on
in
his
soothing
manner
any
other
evidence
will
be
simply
confirmatory
,
a
mere
matter
of
form
.
i
see
.
a
faint
expression
of
relief
swept
over
john
s
face
.
it
puzzled
me
,
for
i
saw
no
occasion
for
it
.
if
you
know
of
nothing
to
the
contrary
,
pursued
mr
.
wells
,
i
had
thought
of
friday
.
that
will
give
us
plenty
of
time
for
the
doctor
s
report
.
the
post
mortem
is
to
take
place
to
night
,
i
believe
?
yes
.
then
that
arrangement
will
suit
you
?
perfectly
.
i
need
not
tell
you
,
my
dear
cavendish
,
how
distressed
i
am
at
this
most
tragic
affair
.
can
you
give
us
no
help
in
solving
it
,
monsieur
?
interposed
poirot
,
speaking
for
the
first
time
since
we
had
entered
the
room
.
i
?
yes
,
we
heard
that
mrs
.
inglethorp
wrote
to
you
last
night
.
you
should
have
received
the
letter
this
morning
.
i
did
,
but
it
contains
no
information
.
it
is
merely
a
note
asking
me
to
call
upon
her
this
morning
,
as
she
wanted
my
advice
on
a
matter
of
great
importance
.
she
gave
you
no
hint
as
to
what
that
matter
might
be
?
unfortunately
,
no
.
that
is
a
pity
,
said
john
.
a
great
pity
,
agreed
poirot
gravely
.
there
was
silence
.
poirot
remained
lost
in
thought
for
a
few
minutes
.
finally
he
turned
to
the
lawyer
again
.
mr
.
wells
,
there
is
one
thing
i
should
like
to
ask
you
that
is
,
if
it
is
not
against
professional
etiquette
.
in
the
event
of
mrs
.
inglethorp
s
death
,
who
would
inherit
her
money
?
the
lawyer
hesitated
a
moment
,
and
then
replied
the
knowledge
will
be
public
property
very
soon
,
so
if
mr
.
cavendish
does
not
object
not
at
all
,
interpolated
john
.
i
do
not
see
any
reason
why
i
should
not
answer
your
question
.
by
her
last
will
,
dated
august
of
last
year
,
after
various
unimportant
legacies
to
servants
,
etc
.,
she
gave
her
entire
fortune
to
her
stepson
,
mr
.
john
cavendish
.
was
not
that
pardon
the
question
,
mr
.
cavendish
rather
unfair
to
her
other
stepson
,
mr
.
lawrence
cavendish
?
no
,
i
do
not
think
so
.
you
see
,
under
the
terms
of
their
father
s
will
,
while
john
inherited
the
property
,
lawrence
,
at
his
stepmother
s
death
,
would
come
into
a
considerable
sum
of
money
.
mrs
.
inglethorp
left
her
money
to
her
elder
stepson
,
knowing
that
he
would
have
to
keep
up
styles
.
it
was
,
to
my
mind
,
a
very
fair
and
equitable
distribution
.
poirot
nodded
thoughtfully
.
i
see
.
but
i
am
right
in
saying
,
am
i
not
,
that
by
your
english
law
that
will
was
automatically
revoked
when
mrs
.
inglethorp
remarried
?
mr
.
wells
bowed
his
head
.
as
i
was
about
to
proceed
,
monsieur
poirot
,
that
document
is
now
null
and
void
.
hein
!
said
poirot
.
he
reflected
for
a
moment
,
and
then
asked
was
mrs
.
inglethorp
herself
aware
of
that
fact
?
i
do
not
know
.
she
may
have
been
.
she
was
,
said
john
unexpectedly
.
we
were
discussing
the
matter
of
wills
being
revoked
by
marriage
only
yesterday
.
ah
!
one
more
question
,
mr
.
wells
.
you
say
her
last
will
.
had
mrs
.
inglethorp
,
then
,
made
several
former
wills
?
on
an
average
,
she
made
a
new
will
at
least
once
a
year
,
said
mr
.
wells
imperturbably
.
she
was
given
to
changing
her
mind
as
to
her
testamentary
dispositions
,
now
benefiting
one
,
now
another
member
of
her
family
.
suppose
,
suggested
poirot
,
that
,
unknown
to
you
,
she
had
made
a
new
will
in
favour
of
someone
who
was
not
,
in
any
sense
of
the
word
,
a
member
of
the
family
we
will
say
miss
howard
,
for
instance
would
you
be
surprised
?
not
in
the
least
.
ah
!
poirot
seemed
to
have
exhausted
his
questions
.
i
drew
close
to
him
,
while
john
and
the
lawyer
were
debating
the
question
of
going
through
mrs
.
inglethorp
s
papers
.
do
you
think
mrs
.
inglethorp
made
a
will
leaving
all
her
money
to
miss
howard
?
i
asked
in
a
low
voice
,
with
some
curiosity
.
poirot
smiled
.
no
.
then
why
did
you
ask
?
hush
!
john
cavendish
had
turned
to
poirot
.
will
you
come
with
us
,
monsieur
poirot
?
we
are
going
through
my
mother
s
papers
.
mr
.
inglethorp
is
quite
willing
to
leave
it
entirely
to
mr
.
wells
and
myself
.
which
simplifies
matters
very
much
,
murmured
the
lawyer
.
as
technically
,
of
course
,
he
was
entitled
he
did
not
finish
the
sentence
.
we
will
look
through
the
desk
in
the
boudoir
first
,
explained
john
,
and
go
up
to
her
bedroom
afterwards
.
she
kept
her
most
important
papers
in
a
purple
despatch
case
,
which
we
must
look
through
carefully
.
yes
,
said
the
lawyer
,
it
is
quite
possible
that
there
may
be
a
later
will
than
the
one
in
my
possession
.
there
is
a
later
will
.
it
was
poirot
who
spoke
.
what
?
john
and
the
lawyer
looked
at
him
startled
.
or
,
rather
,
pursued
my
friend
imperturbably
,
there
was
one
.
what
do
you
mean
there
was
one
?
where
is
it
now
?
burnt
!
burnt
?
yes
.
see
here
.
he
took
out
the
charred
fragment
we
had
found
in
the
grate
in
mrs
.
inglethorp
s
room
,
and
handed
it
to
the
lawyer
with
a
brief
explanation
of
when
and
where
he
had
found
it
.
but
possibly
this
is
an
old
will
?
i
do
not
think
so
.
in
fact
i
am
almost
certain
that
it
was
made
no
earlier
than
yesterday
afternoon
.
what
?
impossible
!
broke
simultaneously
from
both
men
.
poirot
turned
to
john
.
if
you
will
allow
me
to
send
for
your
gardener
,
i
will
prove
it
to
you
.
oh
,
of
course
but
i
don
t
see
poirot
raised
his
hand
.
do
as
i
ask
you
.
afterwards
you
shall
question
as
much
as
you
please
.
very
well
.
he
rang
the
bell
.
dorcas
answered
it
in
due
course
.
dorcas
,
will
you
tell
manning
to
come
round
and
speak
to
me
here
.
yes
,
sir
.
dorcas
withdrew
.
we
waited
in
a
tense
silence
.
poirot
alone
seemed
perfectly
at
his
ease
,
and
dusted
a
forgotten
corner
of
the
bookcase
.
the
clumping
of
hobnailed
boots
on
the
gravel
outside
proclaimed
the
approach
of
manning
.
john
looked
questioningly
at
poirot
.
the
latter
nodded
.
come
inside
,
manning
,
said
john
,
i
want
to
speak
to
you
.
manning
came
slowly
and
hesitatingly
through
the
french
window
,
and
stood
as
near
it
as
he
could
.
he
held
his
cap
in
his
hands
,
twisting
it
very
carefully
round
and
round
.
his
back
was
much
bent
,
though
he
was
probably
not
as
old
as
he
looked
,
but
his
eyes
were
sharp
and
intelligent
,
and
belied
his
slow
and
rather
cautious
speech
.
manning
,
said
john
,
this
gentleman
will
put
some
questions
to
you
which
i
want
you
to
answer
.
yessir
,
mumbled
manning
.
poirot
stepped
forward
briskly
.
manning
s
eye
swept
over
him
with
a
faint
contempt
.
you
were
planting
a
bed
of
begonias
round
by
the
south
side
of
the
house
yesterday
afternoon
,
were
you
not
,
manning
?
yes
,
sir
,
me
and
willum
.
and
mrs
.
inglethorp
came
to
the
window
and
called
you
,
did
she
not
?
yes
,
sir
,
she
did
.
tell
me
in
your
own
words
exactly
what
happened
after
that
.
well
,
sir
,
nothing
much
.
she
just
told
willum
to
go
on
his
bicycle
down
to
the
village
,
and
bring
back
a
form
of
will
,
or
such
like
i
don
t
know
what
exactly
she
wrote
it
down
for
him
.
well
?
well
,
he
did
,
sir
.
and
what
happened
next
?
we
went
on
with
the
begonias
,
sir
.
did
not
mrs
.
inglethorp
call
you
again
?
yes
,
sir
,
both
me
and
willum
,
she
called
.
and
then
?
she
made
us
come
right
in
,
and
sign
our
names
at
the
bottom
of
a
long
paper
under
where
she
d
signed
.
did
you
see
anything
of
what
was
written
above
her
signature
?
asked
poirot
sharply
.
no
,
sir
,
there
was
a
bit
of
blotting
paper
over
that
part
.
and
you
signed
where
she
told
you
?
yes
,
sir
,
first
me
and
then
willum
.
what
did
she
do
with
it
afterwards
?
well
,
sir
,
she
slipped
it
into
a
long
envelope
,
and
put
it
inside
a
sort
of
purple
box
that
was
standing
on
the
desk
.
what
time
was
it
when
she
first
called
you
?
about
four
,
i
should
say
,
sir
.
not
earlier
?
couldn
t
it
have
been
about
half
past
three
?
no
,
i
shouldn
t
say
so
,
sir
.
it
would
be
more
likely
to
be
a
bit
after
four
not
before
it
.
thank
you
,
manning
,
that
will
do
,
said
poirot
pleasantly
.
the
gardener
glanced
at
his
master
,
who
nodded
,
whereupon
manning
lifted
a
finger
to
his
forehead
with
a
low
mumble
,
and
backed
cautiously
out
of
the
window
.
we
all
looked
at
each
other
.
good
heavens
!
murmured
john
.
what
an
extraordinary
coincidence
.
how
a
coincidence
?
that
my
mother
should
have
made
a
will
on
the
very
day
of
her
death
!
mr
.
wells
cleared
his
throat
and
remarked
drily
are
you
so
sure
it
is
a
coincidence
,
cavendish
?
what
do
you
mean
?
your
mother
,
you
tell
me
,
had
a
violent
quarrel
with
someone
yesterday
afternoon
what
do
you
mean
?
cried
john
again
.
there
was
a
tremor
in
his
voice
,
and
he
had
gone
very
pale
.
in
consequence
of
that
quarrel
,
your
mother
very
suddenly
and
hurriedly
makes
a
new
will
.
the
contents
of
that
will
we
shall
never
know
.
she
told
no
one
of
its
provisions
.
this
morning
,
no
doubt
,
she
would
have
consulted
me
on
the
subject
but
she
had
no
chance
.
the
will
disappears
,
and
she
takes
its
secret
with
her
to
her
grave
.
cavendish
,
i
much
fear
there
is
no
coincidence
there
.
monsieur
poirot
,
i
am
sure
you
agree
with
me
that
the
facts
are
very
suggestive
.
suggestive
,
or
not
,
interrupted
john
,
we
are
most
grateful
to
monsieur
poirot
for
elucidating
the
matter
.
but
for
him
,
we
should
never
have
known
of
this
will
.
i
suppose
,
i
may
not
ask
you
,
monsieur
,
what
first
led
you
to
suspect
the
fact
?
poirot
smiled
and
answered
a
scribbled
over
old
envelope
,
and
a
freshly
planted
bed
of
begonias
.
john
,
i
think
,
would
have
pressed
his
questions
further
,
but
at
that
moment
the
loud
purr
of
a
motor
was
audible
,
and
we
all
turned
to
the
window
as
it
swept
past
.
evie
!
cried
john
.
excuse
me
,
wells
.
he
went
hurriedly
out
into
the
hall
.
poirot
looked
inquiringly
at
me
.
miss
howard
,
i
explained
.
ah
,
i
am
glad
she
has
come
.
there
is
a
woman
with
a
head
and
a
heart
too
,
hastings
.
though
the
good
god
gave
her
no
beauty
!
i
followed
john
s
example
,
and
went
out
into
the
hall
,
where
miss
howard
was
endeavouring
to
extricate
herself
from
the
voluminous
mass
of
veils
that
enveloped
her
head
.
as
her
eyes
fell
on
me
,
a
sudden
pang
of
guilt
shot
through
me
.
this
was
the
woman
who
had
warned
me
so
earnestly
,
and
to
whose
warning
i
had
,
alas
,
paid
no
heed
!
how
soon
,
and
how
contemptuously
,
i
had
dismissed
it
from
my
mind
.
now
that
she
had
been
proved
justified
in
so
tragic
a
manner
,
i
felt
ashamed
.
she
had
known
alfred
inglethorp
only
too
well
.
i
wondered
whether
,
if
she
had
remained
at
styles
,
the
tragedy
would
have
taken
place
,
or
would
the
man
have
feared
her
watchful
eyes
?
i
was
relieved
when
she
shook
me
by
the
hand
,
with
her
well
remembered
painful
grip
.
the
eyes
that
met
mine
were
sad
,
but
not
reproachful
that
she
had
been
crying
bitterly
,
i
could
tell
by
the
redness
of
her
eyelids
,
but
her
manner
was
unchanged
from
its
old
gruffness
.
started
the
moment
i
got
the
wire
.
just
come
off
night
duty
.
hired
car
.
quickest
way
to
get
here
.
have
you
had
anything
to
eat
this
morning
,
evie
?
asked
john
.
no
.
i
thought
not
.
come
along
,
breakfast
s
not
cleared
away
yet
,
and
they
ll
make
you
some
fresh
tea
.
he
turned
to
me
.
look
after
her
,
hastings
,
will
you
?
wells
is
waiting
for
me
.
oh
,
here
s
monsieur
poirot
.
he
s
helping
us
,
you
know
,
evie
.
miss
howard
shook
hands
with
poirot
,
but
glanced
suspiciously
over
her
shoulder
at
john
.
what
do
you
mean
helping
us
?
helping
us
to
investigate
.
nothing
to
investigate
.
have
they
taken
him
to
prison
yet
?
taken
who
to
prison
?
who
?
alfred
inglethorp
,
of
course
!
my
dear
evie
,
do
be
careful
.
lawrence
is
of
the
opinion
that
my
mother
died
from
heart
seizure
.
more
fool
,
lawrence
!
retorted
miss
howard
.
of
course
alfred
inglethorp
murdered
poor
emily
as
i
always
told
you
he
would
.
my
dear
evie
,
don
t
shout
so
.
whatever
we
may
think
or
suspect
,
it
is
better
to
say
as
little
as
possible
for
the
present
.
the
inquest
isn
t
until
friday
.
not
until
fiddlesticks
!
the
snort
miss
howard
gave
was
truly
magnificent
.
you
re
all
off
your
heads
.
the
man
will
be
out
of
the
country
by
then
.
if
he
s
any
sense
,
he
won
t
stay
here
tamely
and
wait
to
be
hanged
.
john
cavendish
looked
at
her
helplessly
.
i
know
what
it
is
,
she
accused
him
,
you
ve
been
listening
to
the
doctors
.
never
should
.
what
do
they
know
?
nothing
at
all
or
just
enough
to
make
them
dangerous
.
i
ought
to
know
my
own
father
was
a
doctor
.
that
little
wilkins
is
about
the
greatest
fool
that
even
i
have
ever
seen
.
heart
seizure
!
sort
of
thing
he
would
say
.
anyone
with
any
sense
could
see
at
once
that
her
husband
had
poisoned
her
.
i
always
said
he
d
murder
her
in
her
bed
,
poor
soul
.
now
he
s
done
it
.
and
all
you
can
do
is
to
murmur
silly
things
about
heart
seizure
and
inquest
on
friday
.
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
,
john
cavendish
.
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
?
asked
john
,
unable
to
help
a
faint
smile
.
dash
it
all
,
evie
,
i
can
t
haul
him
down
to
the
local
police
station
by
the
scruff
of
his
neck
.
well
,
you
might
do
something
.
find
out
how
he
did
it
.
he
s
a
crafty
beggar
.
dare
say
he
soaked
fly
papers
.
ask
cook
if
she
s
missed
any
.
it
occurred
to
me
very
forcibly
at
that
moment
that
to
harbour
miss
howard
and
alfred
inglethorp
under
the
same
roof
,
and
keep
the
peace
between
them
,
was
likely
to
prove
a
herculean
task
,
and
i
did
not
envy
john
.
i
could
see
by
the
expression
of
his
face
that
he
fully
appreciated
the
difficulty
of
the
position
.
for
the
moment
,
he
sought
refuge
in
retreat
,
and
left
the
room
precipitately
.
dorcas
brought
in
fresh
tea
.
as
she
left
the
room
,
poirot
came
over
from
the
window
where
he
had
been
standing
,
and
sat
down
facing
miss
howard
.
mademoiselle
,
he
said
gravely
,
i
want
to
ask
you
something
.
ask
away
,
said
the
lady
,
eyeing
him
with
some
disfavour
.
i
want
to
be
able
to
count
upon
your
help
.
i
ll
help
you
to
hang
alfred
with
pleasure
,
she
replied
gruffly
.
hanging
s
too
good
for
him
.
ought
to
be
drawn
and
quartered
,
like
in
good
old
times
.
we
are
at
one
then
,
said
poirot
,
for
i
,
too
,
want
to
hang
the
criminal
.
alfred
inglethorp
?
him
,
or
another
.
no
question
of
another
.
poor
emily
was
never
murdered
until
he
came
along
.
i
don
t
say
she
wasn
t
surrounded
by
sharks
she
was
.
but
it
was
only
her
purse
they
were
after
.
her
life
was
safe
enough
.
but
along
comes
mr
.
alfred
inglethorp
and
within
two
months
hey
presto
!
believe
me
,
miss
howard
,
said
poirot
very
earnestly
,
if
mr
.
inglethorp
is
the
man
,
he
shall
not
escape
me
.
on
my
honour
,
i
will
hang
him
as
high
as
haman
!
that
s
better
,
said
miss
howard
more
enthusiastically
.
but
i
must
ask
you
to
trust
me
.
now
your
help
may
be
very
valuable
to
me
.
i
will
tell
you
why
.
because
,
in
all
this
house
of
mourning
,
yours
are
the
only
eyes
that
have
wept
.
miss
howard
blinked
,
and
a
new
note
crept
into
the
gruffness
of
her
voice
.
if
you
mean
that
i
was
fond
of
her
yes
,
i
was
.
you
know
,
emily
was
a
selfish
old
woman
in
her
way
.
she
was
very
generous
,
but
she
always
wanted
a
return
.
she
never
let
people
forget
what
she
had
done
for
them
and
,
that
way
she
missed
love
.
don
t
think
she
ever
realized
it
,
though
,
or
felt
the
lack
of
it
.
hope
not
,
anyway
.
i
was
on
a
different
footing
.
i
took
my
stand
from
the
first
.
so
many
pounds
a
year
i
m
worth
to
you
.
well
and
good
.
but
not
a
penny
piece
besides
not
a
pair
of
gloves
,
nor
a
theatre
ticket
.
she
didn
t
understand
was
very
offended
sometimes
.
said
i
was
foolishly
proud
.
it
wasn
t
that
but
i
couldn
t
explain
.
anyway
,
i
kept
my
self
respect
.
and
so
,
out
of
the
whole
bunch
,
i
was
the
only
one
who
could
allow
myself
to
be
fond
of
her
.
i
watched
over
her
.
i
guarded
her
from
the
lot
of
them
,
and
then
a
glib
tongued
scoundrel
comes
along
,
and
pooh
!
all
my
years
of
devotion
go
for
nothing
.
poirot
nodded
sympathetically
.
i
understand
,
mademoiselle
,
i
understand
all
you
feel
.
it
is
most
natural
.
you
think
that
we
are
lukewarm
that
we
lack
fire
and
energy
but
trust
me
,
it
is
not
so
.
john
stuck
his
head
in
at
this
juncture
,
and
invited
us
both
to
come
up
to
mrs
.
inglethorp
s
room
,
as
he
and
mr
.
wells
had
finished
looking
through
the
desk
in
the
boudoir
.
as
we
went
up
the
stairs
,
john
looked
back
to
the
dining
room
door
,
and
lowered
his
voice
confidentially
look
here
,
what
s
going
to
happen
when
these
two
meet
?
i
shook
my
head
helplessly
.
i
ve
told
mary
to
keep
them
apart
if
she
can
.
will
she
be
able
to
do
so
?
the
lord
only
knows
.
there
s
one
thing
,
inglethorp
himself
won
t
be
too
keen
on
meeting
her
.
you
ve
got
the
keys
still
,
haven
t
you
,
poirot
?
i
asked
,
as
we
reached
the
door
of
the
locked
room
.
taking
the
keys
from
poirot
,
john
unlocked
it
,
and
we
all
passed
in
.
the
lawyer
went
straight
to
the
desk
,
and
john
followed
him
.
my
mother
kept
most
of
her
important
papers
in
this
despatch
case
,
i
believe
,
he
said
.
poirot
drew
out
the
small
bunch
of
keys
.
permit
me
.
i
locked
it
,
out
of
precaution
,
this
morning
.
but
it
s
not
locked
now
.
impossible
!
see
.
and
john
lifted
the
lid
as
he
spoke
.
milles
tonnerres
!
cried
poirot
,
dumbfounded
.
and
i
who
have
both
the
keys
in
my
pocket
!
he
flung
himself
upon
the
case
.
suddenly
he
stiffened
.
eh
voil
une
affaire
!
this
lock
has
been
forced
.
what
?
poirot
laid
down
the
case
again
.
but
who
forced
it
?
why
should
they
?
when
?
but
the
door
was
locked
?
these
exclamations
burst
from
us
disjointedly
.
poirot
answered
them
categorically
almost
mechanically
.
who
?
that
is
the
question
.
why
?
ah
,
if
i
only
knew
.
when
?
since
i
was
here
an
hour
ago
.
as
to
the
door
being
locked
,
it
is
a
very
ordinary
lock
.
probably
any
other
of
the
doorkeys
in
this
passage
would
fit
it
.
we
stared
at
one
another
blankly
.
poirot
had
walked
over
to
the
mantelpiece
.
he
was
outwardly
calm
,
but
i
noticed
his
hands
,
which
from
long
force
of
habit
were
mechanically
straightening
the
spill
vases
on
the
mantelpiece
,
were
shaking
violently
.
see
here
,
it
was
like
this
,
he
said
at
last
.
there
was
something
in
that
case
some
piece
of
evidence
,
slight
in
itself
perhaps
,
but
still
enough
of
a
clue
to
connect
the
murderer
with
the
crime
.
it
was
vital
to
him
that
it
should
be
destroyed
before
it
was
discovered
and
its
significance
appreciated
.
therefore
,
he
took
the
risk
,
the
great
risk
,
of
coming
in
here
.
finding
the
case
locked
,
he
was
obliged
to
force
it
,
thus
betraying
his
presence
.
for
him
to
take
that
risk
,
it
must
have
been
something
of
great
importance
.
but
what
was
it
?
ah
!
cried
poirot
,
with
a
gesture
of
anger
.
that
,
i
do
not
know
!
a
document
of
some
kind
,
without
doubt
,
possibly
the
scrap
of
paper
dorcas
saw
in
her
hand
yesterday
afternoon
.
and
i
his
anger
burst
forth
freely
miserable
animal
that
i
am
!
i
guessed
nothing
!
i
have
behaved
like
an
imbecile
!
i
should
never
have
left
that
case
here
.
i
should
have
carried
it
away
with
me
.
ah
,
triple
pig
!
and
now
it
is
gone
.
it
is
destroyed
but
is
it
destroyed
?
is
there
not
yet
a
chance
we
must
leave
no
stone
unturned
he
rushed
like
a
madman
from
the
room
,
and
i
followed
him
as
soon
as
i
had
sufficiently
recovered
my
wits
.
but
,
by
the
time
i
had
reached
the
top
of
the
stairs
,
he
was
out
of
sight
.
mary
cavendish
was
standing
where
the
staircase
branched
,
staring
down
into
the
hall
in
the
direction
in
which
he
had
disappeared
.
what
has
happened
to
your
extraordinary
little
friend
,
mr
.
hastings
?
he
has
just
rushed
past
me
like
a
mad
bull
.
he
s
rather
upset
about
something
,
i
remarked
feebly
.
i
really
did
not
know
how
much
poirot
would
wish
me
to
disclose
.
as
i
saw
a
faint
smile
gather
on
mrs
.
cavendish
s
expressive
mouth
,
i
endeavoured
to
try
and
turn
the
conversation
by
saying
they
haven
t
met
yet
,
have
they
?
who
?
mr
.
inglethorp
and
miss
howard
.
she
looked
at
me
in
rather
a
disconcerting
manner
.
do
you
think
it
would
be
such
a
disaster
if
they
did
meet
?
well
,
don
t
you
?
i
said
,
rather
taken
aback
.
no
.
she
was
smiling
in
her
quiet
way
.
i
should
like
to
see
a
good
flare
up
.
it
would
clear
the
air
.
at
present
we
are
all
thinking
so
much
,
and
saying
so
little
.
john
doesn
t
think
so
,
i
remarked
.
he
s
anxious
to
keep
them
apart
.
oh
,
john
!
something
in
her
tone
fired
me
,
and
i
blurted
out
old
john
s
an
awfully
good
sort
.
she
studied
me
curiously
for
a
minute
or
two
,
and
then
said
,
to
my
great
surprise
you
are
loyal
to
your
friend
.
i
like
you
for
that
.
aren
t
you
my
friend
too
?
i
am
a
very
bad
friend
.
why
do
you
say
that
?
because
it
is
true
.
i
am
charming
to
my
friends
one
day
,
and
forget
all
about
them
the
next
.
i
don
t
know
what
impelled
me
,
but
i
was
nettled
,
and
i
said
foolishly
and
not
in
the
best
of
taste
yet
you
seem
to
be
invariably
charming
to
dr
.
bauerstein
!
instantly
i
regretted
my
words
.
her
face
stiffened
.
i
had
the
impression
of
a
steel
curtain
coming
down
and
blotting
out
the
real
woman
.
without
a
word
,
she
turned
and
went
swiftly
up
the
stairs
,
whilst
i
stood
like
an
idiot
gaping
after
her
.
i
was
recalled
to
other
matters
by
a
frightful
row
going
on
below
.
i
could
hear
poirot
shouting
and
expounding
.
i
was
vexed
to
think
that
my
diplomacy
had
been
in
vain
.
the
little
man
appeared
to
be
taking
the
whole
house
into
his
confidence
,
a
proceeding
of
which
i
,
for
one
,
doubted
the
wisdom
.
once
again
i
could
not
help
regretting
that
my
friend
was
so
prone
to
lose
his
head
in
moments
of
excitement
.
i
stepped
briskly
down
the
stairs
.
the
sight
of
me
calmed
poirot
almost
immediately
.
i
drew
him
aside
.
my
dear
fellow
,
i
said
,
is
this
wise
?
surely
you
don
t
want
the
whole
house
to
know
of
this
occurrence
?
you
are
actually
playing
into
the
criminal
s
hands
.
you
think
so
,
hastings
?
i
am
sure
of
it
.
well
,
well
,
my
friend
,
i
will
be
guided
by
you
.
good
.
although
,
unfortunately
,
it
is
a
little
too
late
now
.
sure
.
he
looked
so
crestfallen
and
abashed
that
i
felt
quite
sorry
,
though
i
still
thought
my
rebuke
a
just
and
wise
one
.
well
,
he
said
at
last
,
let
us
go
,
mon
ami
.
you
have
finished
here
?
for
the
moment
,
yes
.
you
will
walk
back
with
me
to
the
village
?
willingly
.
he
picked
up
his
little
suit
case
,
and
we
went
out
through
the
open
window
in
the
drawing
room
.
cynthia
murdoch
was
just
coming
in
,
and
poirot
stood
aside
to
let
her
pass
.
excuse
me
,
mademoiselle
,
one
minute
.
yes
?
she
turned
inquiringly
.
did
you
ever
make
up
mrs
.
inglethorp
s
medicines
?
a
slight
flush
rose
in
her
face
,
as
she
answered
rather
constrainedly
no
.
only
her
powders
?
the
flush
deepened
as
cynthia
replied
oh
,
yes
,
i
did
make
up
some
sleeping
powders
for
her
once
.
these
?
poirot
produced
the
empty
box
which
had
contained
powders
.
she
nodded
.
can
you
tell
me
what
they
were
?
sulphonal
?
veronal
?
no
,
they
were
bromide
powders
.
ah
!
thank
you
,
mademoiselle
good
morning
.
as
we
walked
briskly
away
from
the
house
,
i
glanced
at
him
more
than
once
.
i
had
often
before
noticed
that
,
if
anything
excited
him
,
his
eyes
turned
green
like
a
cat
s
.
they
were
shining
like
emeralds
now
.
my
friend
,
he
broke
out
at
last
,
i
have
a
little
idea
,
a
very
strange
,
and
probably
utterly
impossible
idea
.
and
yet
it
fits
in
.
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
.
i
privately
thought
that
poirot
was
rather
too
much
given
to
these
fantastic
ideas
.
in
this
case
,
surely
,
the
truth
was
only
too
plain
and
apparent
.
so
that
is
the
explanation
of
the
blank
label
on
the
box
,
i
remarked
.
very
simple
,
as
you
said
.
i
really
wonder
that
i
did
not
think
of
it
myself
.
poirot
did
not
appear
to
be
listening
to
me
.
they
have
made
one
more
discovery
,
l
bas
,
he
observed
,
jerking
his
thumb
over
his
shoulder
in
the
direction
of
styles
.
mr
.
wells
told
me
as
we
were
going
upstairs
.
what
was
it
?
locked
up
in
the
desk
in
the
boudoir
,
they
found
a
will
of
mrs
.
inglethorp
s
,
dated
before
her
marriage
,
leaving
her
fortune
to
alfred
inglethorp
.
it
must
have
been
made
just
at
the
time
they
were
engaged
.
it
came
quite
as
a
surprise
to
wells
and
to
john
cavendish
also
.
it
was
written
on
one
of
those
printed
will
forms
,
and
witnessed
by
two
of
the
servants
not
dorcas
.
did
mr
.
inglethorp
know
of
it
?
he
says
not
.
one
might
take
that
with
a
grain
of
salt
,
i
remarked
sceptically
.
all
these
wills
are
very
confusing
.
tell
me
,
how
did
those
scribbled
words
on
the
envelope
help
you
to
discover
that
a
will
was
made
yesterday
afternoon
?
poirot
smiled
.
mon
ami
,
have
you
ever
,
when
writing
a
letter
,
been
arrested
by
the
fact
that
you
did
not
know
how
to
spell
a
certain
word
?
yes
,
often
.
i
suppose
everyone
has
.
exactly
.
and
have
you
not
,
in
such
a
case
,
tried
the
word
once
or
twice
on
the
edge
of
the
blotting
paper
,
or
a
spare
scrap
of
paper
,
to
see
if
it
looked
right
?
well
,
that
is
what
mrs
.
inglethorp
did
.
you
will
notice
that
the
word
possessed
is
spelt
first
with
one
s
and
subsequently
with
two
correctly
.
to
make
sure
,
she
had
further
tried
it
in
a
sentence
,
thus
i
am
possessed
.
now
,
what
did
that
tell
me
?
it
told
me
that
mrs
.
inglethorp
had
been
writing
the
word
possessed
that
afternoon
,
and
,
having
the
fragment
of
paper
found
in
the
grate
fresh
in
my
mind
,
the
possibility
of
a
will
a
document
almost
certain
to
contain
that
word
occurred
to
me
at
once
.
this
possibility
was
confirmed
by
a
further
circumstance
.
in
the
general
confusion
,
the
boudoir
had
not
been
swept
that
morning
,
and
near
the
desk
were
several
traces
of
brown
mould
and
earth
.
the
weather
had
been
perfectly
fine
for
some
days
,
and
no
ordinary
boots
would
have
left
such
a
heavy
deposit
.
i
strolled
to
the
window
,
and
saw
at
once
that
the
begonia
beds
had
been
newly
planted
.
the
mould
in
the
beds
was
exactly
similar
to
that
on
the
floor
of
the
boudoir
,
and
also
i
learnt
from
you
that
they
had
been
planted
yesterday
afternoon
.
i
was
now
sure
that
one
,
or
possibly
both
of
the
gardeners
for
there
were
two
sets
of
footprints
in
the
bed
had
entered
the
boudoir
,
for
if
mrs
.
inglethorp
had
merely
wished
to
speak
to
them
she
would
in
all
probability
have
stood
at
the
window
,
and
they
would
not
have
come
into
the
room
at
all
.
i
was
now
quite
convinced
that
she
had
made
a
fresh
will
,
and
had
called
the
two
gardeners
in
to
witness
her
signature
.
events
proved
that
i
was
right
in
my
supposition
.
that
was
very
ingenious
,
i
could
not
help
admitting
.
i
must
confess
that
the
conclusions
i
drew
from
those
few
scribbled
words
were
quite
erroneous
.
he
smiled
.
you
gave
too
much
rein
to
your
imagination
.
imagination
is
a
good
servant
,
and
a
bad
master
.
the
simplest
explanation
is
always
the
most
likely
.
another
point
how
did
you
know
that
the
key
of
the
despatch
case
had
been
lost
?
i
did
not
know
it
.
it
was
a
guess
that
turned
out
to
be
correct
.
you
observed
that
it
had
a
piece
of
twisted
wire
through
the
handle
.
that
suggested
to
me
at
once
that
it
had
possibly
been
wrenched
off
a
flimsy
key
ring
.
now
,
if
it
had
been
lost
and
recovered
,
mrs
.
inglethorp
would
at
once
have
replaced
it
on
her
bunch
but
on
her
bunch
i
found
what
was
obviously
the
duplicate
key
,
very
new
and
bright
,
which
led
me
to
the
hypothesis
that
somebody
else
had
inserted
the
original
key
in
the
lock
of
the
despatch
case
.
yes
,
i
said
,
alfred
inglethorp
,
without
doubt
.
poirot
looked
at
me
curiously
.
you
are
very
sure
of
his
guilt
?
well
,
naturally
.
every
fresh
circumstance
seems
to
establish
it
more
clearly
.
on
the
contrary
,
said
poirot
quietly
,
there
are
several
points
in
his
favour
.
oh
,
come
now
!
yes
.
i
see
only
one
.
and
that
?
that
he
was
not
in
the
house
last
night
.
bad
shot
!
as
you
english
say
!
you
have
chosen
the
one
point
that
to
my
mind
tells
against
him
.
how
is
that
?
because
if
mr
.
inglethorp
knew
that
his
wife
would
be
poisoned
last
night
,
he
would
certainly
have
arranged
to
be
away
from
the
house
.
his
excuse
was
an
obviously
trumped
up
one
.
that
leaves
us
two
possibilities
either
he
knew
what
was
going
to
happen
or
he
had
a
reason
of
his
own
for
his
absence
.
and
that
reason
?
i
asked
sceptically
.
poirot
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
how
should
i
know
?
discreditable
,
without
doubt
.
this
mr
.
inglethorp
,
i
should
say
,
is
somewhat
of
a
scoundrel
but
that
does
not
of
necessity
make
him
a
murderer
.
i
shook
my
head
,
unconvinced
.
we
do
not
agree
,
eh
?
said
poirot
.
well
,
let
us
leave
it
.
time
will
show
which
of
us
is
right
.
now
let
us
turn
to
other
aspects
of
the
case
.
what
do
you
make
of
the
fact
that
all
the
doors
of
the
bedroom
were
bolted
on
the
inside
?
well
i
considered
.
one
must
look
at
it
logically
.
true
.
i
should
put
it
this
way
.
the
doors
were
bolted
our
own
eyes
have
told
us
that
yet
the
presence
of
the
candle
grease
on
the
floor
,
and
the
destruction
of
the
will
,
prove
that
during
the
night
someone
entered
the
room
.
you
agree
so
far
?
perfectly
.
put
with
admirable
clearness
.
proceed
.
well
,
i
said
,
encouraged
,
as
the
person
who
entered
did
not
do
so
by
the
window
,
nor
by
miraculous
means
,
it
follows
that
the
door
must
have
been
opened
from
inside
by
mrs
.
inglethorp
herself
.
that
strengthens
the
conviction
that
the
person
in
question
was
her
husband
.
she
would
naturally
open
the
door
to
her
own
husband
.
poirot
shook
his
head
.
why
should
she
?
she
had
bolted
the
door
leading
into
his
room
a
most
unusual
proceeding
on
her
part
she
had
had
a
most
violent
quarrel
with
him
that
very
afternoon
.
no
,
he
was
the
last
person
she
would
admit
.
but
you
agree
with
me
that
the
door
must
have
been
opened
by
mrs
.
inglethorp
herself
?
there
is
another
possibility
.
she
may
have
forgotten
to
bolt
the
door
into
the
passage
when
she
went
to
bed
,
and
have
got
up
later
,
towards
morning
,
and
bolted
it
then
.
poirot
,
is
that
seriously
your
opinion
?
no
,
i
do
not
say
it
is
so
,
but
it
might
be
.
now
,
to
turn
to
another
feature
,
what
do
you
make
of
the
scrap
of
conversation
you
overheard
between
mrs
.
cavendish
and
her
mother
in
law
?
i
had
forgotten
that
,
i
said
thoughtfully
.
that
is
as
enigmatical
as
ever
.
it
seems
incredible
that
a
woman
like
mrs
.
cavendish
,
proud
and
reticent
to
the
last
degree
,
should
interfere
so
violently
in
what
was
certainly
not
her
affair
.
precisely
.
it
was
an
astonishing
thing
for
a
woman
of
her
breeding
to
do
.
it
is
certainly
curious
,
i
agreed
.
still
,
it
is
unimportant
,
and
need
not
be
taken
into
account
.
a
groan
burst
from
poirot
.
what
have
i
always
told
you
?
everything
must
be
taken
into
account
.
if
the
fact
will
not
fit
the
theory
let
the
theory
go
.
well
,
we
shall
see
,
i
said
,
nettled
.
yes
,
we
shall
see
.
we
had
reached
leastways
cottage
,
and
poirot
ushered
me
upstairs
to
his
own
room
.
he
offered
me
one
of
the
tiny
russian
cigarettes
he
himself
occasionally
smoked
.
i
was
amused
to
notice
that
he
stowed
away
the
used
matches
most
carefully
in
a
little
china
pot
.
my
momentary
annoyance
vanished
.
poirot
had
placed
our
two
chairs
in
front
of
the
open
window
which
commanded
a
view
of
the
village
street
.
the
fresh
air
blew
in
warm
and
pleasant
.
it
was
going
to
be
a
hot
day
.
suddenly
my
attention
was
arrested
by
a
weedy
looking
young
man
rushing
down
the
street
at
a
great
pace
.
it
was
the
expression
on
his
face
that
was
extraordinary
a
curious
mingling
of
terror
and
agitation
.
look
,
poirot
!
i
said
.
he
leant
forward
.
tiens
!
he
said
.
it
is
mr
.
mace
,
from
the
chemist
s
shop
.
he
is
coming
here
.
the
young
man
came
to
a
halt
before
leastways
cottage
,
and
,
after
hesitating
a
moment
,
pounded
vigorously
at
the
door
.
a
little
minute
,
cried
poirot
from
the
window
.
i
come
.
motioning
to
me
to
follow
him
,
he
ran
swiftly
down
the
stairs
and
opened
the
door
.
mr
.
mace
began
at
once
.
oh
,
mr
.
poirot
,
i
m
sorry
for
the
inconvenience
,
but
i
heard
that
you
d
just
come
back
from
the
hall
?
yes
,
we
have
.
the
young
man
moistened
his
dry
lips
.
his
face
was
working
curiously
.
it
s
all
over
the
village
about
old
mrs
.
inglethorp
dying
so
suddenly
.
they
do
say
he
lowered
his
voice
cautiously
that
it
s
poison
?
poirot
s
face
remained
quite
impassive
.
only
the
doctors
can
tell
us
that
,
mr
.
mace
.
yes
,
exactly
of
course
the
young
man
hesitated
,
and
then
his
agitation
was
too
much
for
him
.
he
clutched
poirot
by
the
arm
,
and
sank
his
voice
to
a
whisper
just
tell
me
this
,
mr
.
poirot
,
it
isn
t
it
isn
t
strychnine
,
is
it
?
i
hardly
heard
what
poirot
replied
.
something
evidently
of
a
non
committal
nature
.
the
young
man
departed
,
and
as
he
closed
the
door
poirot
s
eyes
met
mine
.
yes
,
he
said
,
nodding
gravely
.
he
will
have
evidence
to
give
at
the
inquest
.
we
went
slowly
upstairs
again
.
i
was
opening
my
lips
,
when
poirot
stopped
me
with
a
gesture
of
his
hand
.
not
now
,
not
now
,
mon
ami
.
i
have
need
of
reflection
.
my
mind
is
in
some
disorder
which
is
not
well
.
for
about
ten
minutes
he
sat
in
dead
silence
,
perfectly
still
,
except
for
several
expressive
motions
of
his
eyebrows
,
and
all
the
time
his
eyes
grew
steadily
greener
.
at
last
he
heaved
a
deep
sigh
.
it
is
well
.
the
bad
moment
has
passed
.
now
all
is
arranged
and
classified
.
one
must
never
permit
confusion
.
the
case
is
not
clear
yet
no
.
for
it
is
of
the
most
complicated
!
it
puzzles
me
.
me
,
hercule
poirot
!
there
are
two
facts
of
significance
.
and
what
are
they
?
the
first
is
the
state
of
the
weather
yesterday
.
that
is
very
important
.
but
it
was
a
glorious
day
!
i
interrupted
.
poirot
,
you
re
pulling
my
leg
!
not
at
all
.
the
thermometer
registered
degrees
in
the
shade
.
do
not
forget
that
,
my
friend
.
it
is
the
key
to
the
whole
riddle
!
and
the
second
point
?
i
asked
.
the
important
fact
that
monsieur
inglethorp
wears
very
peculiar
clothes
,
has
a
black
beard
,
and
uses
glasses
.
poirot
,
i
cannot
believe
you
are
serious
.
i
am
absolutely
serious
,
my
friend
.
but
this
is
childish
!
no
,
it
is
very
momentous
.
and
supposing
the
coroner
s
jury
returns
a
verdict
of
wilful
murder
against
alfred
inglethorp
.
what
becomes
of
your
theories
,
then
?
they
would
not
be
shaken
because
twelve
stupid
men
had
happened
to
make
a
mistake
!
but
that
will
not
occur
.
for
one
thing
,
a
country
jury
is
not
anxious
to
take
responsibility
upon
itself
,
and
mr
.
inglethorp
stands
practically
in
the
position
of
local
squire
.
also
,
he
added
placidly
,
i
should
not
allow
it
!
you
would
not
allow
it
?
no
.
i
looked
at
the
extraordinary
little
man
,
divided
between
annoyance
and
amusement
.
he
was
so
tremendously
sure
of
himself
.
as
though
he
read
my
thoughts
,
he
nodded
gently
.
oh
,
yes
,
mon
ami
,
i
would
do
what
i
say
.
he
got
up
and
laid
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
.
his
physiognomy
underwent
a
complete
change
.
tears
came
into
his
eyes
.
in
all
this
,
you
see
,
i
think
of
that
poor
mrs
.
inglethorp
who
is
dead
.
she
was
not
extravagantly
loved
no
.
but
she
was
very
good
to
us
belgians
i
owe
her
a
debt
.
i
endeavoured
to
interrupt
,
but
poirot
swept
on
.
let
me
tell
you
this
,
hastings
.
she
would
never
forgive
me
if
i
let
alfred
inglethorp
,
her
husband
,
be
arrested
now
when
a
word
from
me
could
save
him
!
chapter
vi
.
the
inquest
in
the
interval
before
the
inquest
,
poirot
was
unfailing
in
his
activity
.
twice
he
was
closeted
with
mr
.
wells
.
he
also
took
long
walks
into
the
country
.
i
rather
resented
his
not
taking
me
into
his
confidence
,
the
more
so
as
i
could
not
in
the
least
guess
what
he
was
driving
at
.
it
occurred
to
me
that
he
might
have
been
making
inquiries
at
raikes
s
farm
so
,
finding
him
out
when
i
called
at
leastways
cottage
on
wednesday
evening
,
i
walked
over
there
by
the
fields
,
hoping
to
meet
him
.
but
there
was
no
sign
of
him
,
and
i
hesitated
to
go
right
up
to
the
farm
itself
.
as
i
walked
away
,
i
met
an
aged
rustic
,
who
leered
at
me
cunningly
.
you
m
from
the
hall
,
bain
t
you
?
he
asked
.
yes
.
i
m
looking
for
a
friend
of
mine
whom
i
thought
might
have
walked
this
way
.
a
little
chap
?
as
waves
his
hands
when
he
talks
?
one
of
them
belgies
from
the
village
?
yes
,
i
said
eagerly
.
he
has
been
here
,
then
?
oh
,
ay
,
he
s
been
here
,
right
enough
.
more
n
once
too
.
friend
of
yours
,
is
he
?
ah
,
you
gentlemen
from
the
hall
you
m
a
pretty
lot
!
and
he
leered
more
jocosely
than
ever
.
why
,
do
the
gentlemen
from
the
hall
come
here
often
?
i
asked
,
as
carelessly
as
i
could
.
he
winked
at
me
knowingly
.
one
does
,
mister
.
naming
no
names
,
mind
.
and
a
very
liberal
gentleman
too
!
oh
,
thank
you
,
sir
,
i
m
sure
.
i
walked
on
sharply
.
evelyn
howard
had
been
right
then
,
and
i
experienced
a
sharp
twinge
of
disgust
,
as
i
thought
of
alfred
inglethorp
s
liberality
with
another
woman
s
money
.
had
that
piquant
gipsy
face
been
at
the
bottom
of
the
crime
,
or
was
it
the
baser
mainspring
of
money
?
probably
a
judicious
mixture
of
both
.
on
one
point
,
poirot
seemed
to
have
a
curious
obsession
.
he
once
or
twice
observed
to
me
that
he
thought
dorcas
must
have
made
an
error
in
fixing
the
time
of
the
quarrel
.
he
suggested
to
her
repeatedly
that
it
was
four
thirty
,
and
not
four
o
clock
when
she
had
heard
the
voices
.
but
dorcas
was
unshaken
.
quite
an
hour
,
or
even
more
,
had
elapsed
between
the
time
when
she
had
heard
the
voices
and
five
o
clock
,
when
she
had
taken
tea
to
her
mistress
.
the
inquest
was
held
on
friday
at
the
stylites
arms
in
the
village
.
poirot
and
i
sat
together
,
not
being
required
to
give
evidence
.
the
preliminaries
were
gone
through
.
the
jury
viewed
the
body
,
and
john
cavendish
gave
evidence
of
identification
.
further
questioned
,
he
described
his
awakening
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
,
and
the
circumstances
of
his
mother
s
death
.
the
medical
evidence
was
next
taken
.
there
was
a
breathless
hush
,
and
every
eye
was
fixed
on
the
famous
london
specialist
,
who
was
known
to
be
one
of
the
greatest
authorities
of
the
day
on
the
subject
of
toxicology
.
in
a
few
brief
words
,
he
summed
up
the
result
of
the
post
mortem
.
shorn
of
its
medical
phraseology
and
technicalities
,
it
amounted
to
the
fact
that
mrs
.
inglethorp
had
met
her
death
as
the
result
of
strychnine
poisoning
.
judging
from
the
quantity
recovered
,
she
must
have
taken
not
less
than
three
quarters
of
a
grain
of
strychnine
,
but
probably
one
grain
or
slightly
over
.
is
it
possible
that
she
could
have
swallowed
the
poison
by
accident
?
asked
the
coroner
.
i
should
consider
it
very
unlikely
.
strychnine
is
not
used
for
domestic
purposes
,
as
some
poisons
are
,
and
there
are
restrictions
placed
on
its
sale
.
does
anything
in
your
examination
lead
you
to
determine
how
the
poison
was
administered
?
no
.
you
arrived
at
styles
before
dr
.
wilkins
,
i
believe
?
that
is
so
.
the
motor
met
me
just
outside
the
lodge
gates
,
and
i
hurried
there
as
fast
as
i
could
.
will
you
relate
to
us
exactly
what
happened
next
?
i
entered
mrs
.
inglethorp
s
room
.
she
was
at
that
moment
in
a
typical
tetanic
convulsion
.
she
turned
towards
me
,
and
gasped
out
alfred
alfred
could
the
strychnine
have
been
administered
in
mrs
.
inglethorp
s
after
dinner
coffee
which
was
taken
to
her
by
her
husband
?
possibly
,
but
strychnine
is
a
fairly
rapid
drug
in
its
action
.
the
symptoms
appear
from
one
to
two
hours
after
it
has
been
swallowed
.
it
is
retarded
under
certain
conditions
,
none
of
which
,
however
,
appear
to
have
been
present
in
this
case
.
i
presume
mrs
.
inglethorp
took
the
coffee
after
dinner
about
eight
o
clock
,
whereas
the
symptoms
did
not
manifest
themselves
until
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
,
which
,
on
the
face
of
it
,
points
to
the
drug
having
been
taken
much
later
in
the
evening
.
mrs
.
inglethorp
was
in
the
habit
of
drinking
a
cup
of
cocoa
in
the
middle
of
the
night
.
could
the
strychnine
have
been
administered
in
that
?
no
,
i
myself
took
a
sample
of
the
cocoa
remaining
in
the
saucepan
and
had
it
analysed
.
there
was
no
strychnine
present
.
i
heard
poirot
chuckle
softly
beside
me
.
how
did
you
know
?
i
whispered
.
listen
.
i
should
say
the
doctor
was
continuing
that
i
would
have
been
considerably
surprised
at
any
other
result
.
why
?
simply
because
strychnine
has
an
unusually
bitter
taste
.
it
can
be
detected
in
a
solution
of
one
in
seventy
thousand
,
and
can
only
be
disguised
by
some
strongly
flavoured
substance
.
cocoa
would
be
quite
powerless
to
mask
it
.
one
of
the
jury
wanted
to
know
if
the
same
objection
applied
to
coffee
.
no
.
coffee
has
a
bitter
taste
of
its
own
which
would
probably
cover
the
taste
of
strychnine
.
then
you
consider
it
more
likely
that
the
drug
was
administered
in
the
coffee
,
but
that
for
some
unknown
reason
its
action
was
delayed
.
yes
,
but
,
the
cup
being
completely
smashed
,
there
is
no
possibility
of
analyzing
its
contents
.
this
concluded
dr
.
bauerstein
s
evidence
.
dr
.
wilkins
corroborated
it
on
all
points
.
sounded
as
to
the
possibility
of
suicide
,
he
repudiated
it
utterly
.
the
deceased
,
he
said
,
suffered
from
a
weak
heart
,
but
otherwise
enjoyed
perfect
health
,
and
was
of
a
cheerful
and
well
balanced
disposition
.
she
would
be
one
of
the
last
people
to
take
her
own
life
.
lawrence
cavendish
was
next
called
.
his
evidence
was
quite
unimportant
,
being
a
mere
repetition
of
that
of
his
brother
.
just
as
he
was
about
to
step
down
,
he
paused
,
and
said
rather
hesitatingly
i
should
like
to
make
a
suggestion
if
i
may
?
he
glanced
deprecatingly
at
the
coroner
,
who
replied
briskly
certainly
,
mr
.
cavendish
,
we
are
here
to
arrive
at
the
truth
of
this
matter
,
and
welcome
anything
that
may
lead
to
further
elucidation
.
it
is
just
an
idea
of
mine
,
explained
lawrence
.
of
course
i
may
be
quite
wrong
,
but
it
still
seems
to
me
that
my
mother
s
death
might
be
accounted
for
by
natural
means
.
how
do
you
make
that
out
,
mr
.
cavendish
?
my
mother
,
at
the
time
of
her
death
,
and
for
some
time
before
it
,
was
taking
a
tonic
containing
strychnine
.
ah
!
said
the
coroner
.
the
jury
looked
up
,
interested
.
i
believe
,
continued
lawrence
,
that
there
have
been
cases
where
the
cumulative
effect
of
a
drug
,
administered
for
some
time
,
has
ended
by
causing
death
.
also
,
is
it
not
possible
that
she
may
have
taken
an
overdose
of
her
medicine
by
accident
?
this
is
the
first
we
have
heard
of
the
deceased
taking
strychnine
at
the
time
of
her
death
.
we
are
much
obliged
to
you
,
mr
.
cavendish
.
dr
.
wilkins
was
recalled
and
ridiculed
the
idea
.
what
mr
.
cavendish
suggests
is
quite
impossible
.
any
doctor
would
tell
you
the
same
.
strychnine
is
,
in
a
certain
sense
,
a
cumulative
poison
,
but
it
would
be
quite
impossible
for
it
to
result
in
sudden
death
in
this
way
.
there
would
have
to
be
a
long
period
of
chronic
symptoms
which
would
at
once
have
attracted
my
attention
.
the
whole
thing
is
absurd
.
and
the
second
suggestion
?
that
mrs
.
inglethorp
may
have
inadvertently
taken
an
overdose
?
three
,
or
even
four
doses
,
would
not
have
resulted
in
death
.
mrs
.
inglethorp
always
had
an
extra
large
amount
of
medicine
made
up
at
a
time
,
as
she
dealt
with
coot
s
,
the
cash
chemists
in
tadminster
.
she
would
have
had
to
take
very
nearly
the
whole
bottle
to
account
for
the
amount
of
strychnine
found
at
the
post
mortem
.
then
you
consider
that
we
may
dismiss
the
tonic
as
not
being
in
any
way
instrumental
in
causing
her
death
?
certainly
.
the
supposition
is
ridiculous
.
the
same
juryman
who
had
interrupted
before
here
suggested
that
the
chemist
who
made
up
the
medicine
might
have
committed
an
error
.
that
,
of
course
,
is
always
possible
,
replied
the
doctor
.
but
dorcas
,
who
was
the
next
witness
called
,
dispelled
even
that
possibility
.
the
medicine
had
not
been
newly
made
up
.
on
the
contrary
,
mrs
.
inglethorp
had
taken
the
last
dose
on
the
day
of
her
death
.
so
the
question
of
the
tonic
was
finally
abandoned
,
and
the
coroner
proceeded
with
his
task
.
having
elicited
from
dorcas
how
she
had
been
awakened
by
the
violent
ringing
of
her
mistress
s
bell
,
and
had
subsequently
roused
the
household
,
he
passed
to
the
subject
of
the
quarrel
on
the
preceding
afternoon
.
dorcas
s
evidence
on
this
point
was
substantially
what
poirot
and
i
had
already
heard
,
so
i
will
not
repeat
it
here
.
the
next
witness
was
mary
cavendish
.
she
stood
very
upright
,
and
spoke
in
a
low
,
clear
,
and
perfectly
composed
voice
.
in
answer
to
the
coroner
s
question
,
she
told
how
,
her
alarm
clock
having
aroused
her
at
four
thirty
as
usual
,
she
was
dressing
,
when
she
was
startled
by
the
sound
of
something
heavy
falling
.
that
would
have
been
the
table
by
the
bed
?
commented
the
coroner
.
i
opened
my
door
,
continued
mary
,
and
listened
.
in
a
few
minutes
a
bell
rang
violently
.
dorcas
came
running
down
and
woke
my
husband
,
and
we
all
went
to
my
mother
in
law
s
room
,
but
it
was
locked
the
coroner
interrupted
her
.
i
really
do
not
think
we
need
trouble
you
further
on
that
point
.
we
know
all
that
can
be
known
of
the
subsequent
happenings
.
but
i
should
be
obliged
if
you
would
tell
us
all
you
overheard
of
the
quarrel
the
day
before
.
i
?
there
was
a
faint
insolence
in
her
voice
.
she
raised
her
hand
and
adjusted
the
ruffle
of
lace
at
her
neck
,
turning
her
head
a
little
as
she
did
so
.
and
quite
spontaneously
the
thought
flashed
across
my
mind
she
is
gaining
time
!
yes
.
i
understand
,
continued
the
coroner
deliberately
,
that
you
were
sitting
reading
on
the
bench
just
outside
the
long
window
of
the
boudoir
.
that
is
so
,
is
it
not
?
this
was
news
to
me
and
glancing
sideways
at
poirot
,
i
fancied
that
it
was
news
to
him
as
well
.
there
was
the
faintest
pause
,
the
mere
hesitation
of
a
moment
,
before
she
answered
yes
,
that
is
so
.
and
the
boudoir
window
was
open
,
was
it
not
?
surely
her
face
grew
a
little
paler
as
she
answered
yes
.
then
you
cannot
have
failed
to
hear
the
voices
inside
,
especially
as
they
were
raised
in
anger
.
in
fact
,
they
would
be
more
audible
where
you
were
than
in
the
hall
.
possibly
.
will
you
repeat
to
us
what
you
overheard
of
the
quarrel
?
i
really
do
not
remember
hearing
anything
.
do
you
mean
to
say
you
did
not
hear
voices
?
oh
,
yes
,
i
heard
the
voices
,
but
i
did
not
hear
what
they
said
.
a
faint
spot
of
colour
came
into
her
cheek
.
i
am
not
in
the
habit
of
listening
to
private
conversations
.
the
coroner
persisted
.
and
you
remember
nothing
at
all
?
nothing
,
mrs
.
cavendish
?
not
one
stray
word
or
phrase
to
make
you
realize
that
it
was
a
private
conversation
?
she
paused
,
and
seemed
to
reflect
,
still
outwardly
as
calm
as
ever
.
yes
i
remember
.
mrs
.
inglethorp
said
something
i
do
not
remember
exactly
what
about
causing
scandal
between
husband
and
wife
.
ah
!
the
coroner
leant
back
satisfied
.
that
corresponds
with
what
dorcas
heard
.
but
excuse
me
,
mrs
.
cavendish
,
although
you
realized
it
was
a
private
conversation
,
you
did
not
move
away
?
you
remained
where
you
were
?
i
caught
the
momentary
gleam
of
her
tawny
eyes
as
she
raised
them
.
i
felt
certain
that
at
that
moment
she
would
willingly
have
torn
the
little
lawyer
,
with
his
insinuations
,
into
pieces
,
but
she
replied
quietly
enough
no
.
i
was
very
comfortable
where
i
was
.
i
fixed
my
mind
on
my
book
.
and
that
is
all
you
can
tell
us
?
that
is
all
.
the
examination
was
over
,
though
i
doubted
if
the
coroner
was
entirely
satisfied
with
it
.
i
think
he
suspected
that
mary
cavendish
could
tell
more
if
she
chose
.
amy
hill
,
shop
assistant
,
was
next
called
,
and
deposed
to
having
sold
a
will
form
on
the
afternoon
of
the
th
to
william
earl
,
under
gardener
at
styles
.
william
earl
and
manning
succeeded
her
,
and
testified
to
witnessing
a
document
.
manning
fixed
the
time
at
about
four
thirty
,
william
was
of
the
opinion
that
it
was
rather
earlier
.
cynthia
murdoch
came
next
.
she
had
,
however
,
little
to
tell
.
she
had
known
nothing
of
the
tragedy
,
until
awakened
by
mrs
.
cavendish
.
you
did
not
hear
the
table
fall
?
no
.
i
was
fast
asleep
.
the
coroner
smiled
.
a
good
conscience
makes
a
sound
sleeper
,
he
observed
.
thank
you
,
miss
murdoch
,
that
is
all
.
miss
howard
.
miss
howard
produced
the
letter
written
to
her
by
mrs
.
inglethorp
on
the
evening
of
the
th
.
poirot
and
i
had
,
of
course
already
seen
it
.
it
added
nothing
to
our
knowledge
of
the
tragedy
.
the
following
is
a
facsimile
styles
court
essex
hand
written
note
july
th
my
dear
evelyn
can
we
not
bury
the
hachet
?
i
have
found
it
hard
to
forgive
the
things
you
said
against
my
dear
husband
but
i
am
an
old
woman
very
fond
of
you
yours
affectionately
,
emily
inglethorpe
it
was
handed
to
the
jury
who
scrutinized
it
attentively
.
i
fear
it
does
not
help
us
much
,
said
the
coroner
,
with
a
sigh
.
there
is
no
mention
of
any
of
the
events
of
that
afternoon
.
plain
as
a
pikestaff
to
me
,
said
miss
howard
shortly
.
it
shows
clearly
enough
that
my
poor
old
friend
had
just
found
out
she
d
been
made
a
fool
of
!
it
says
nothing
of
the
kind
in
the
letter
,
the
coroner
pointed
out
.
no
,
because
emily
never
could
bear
to
put
herself
in
the
wrong
.
but
i
know
her
.
she
wanted
me
back
.
but
she
wasn
t
going
to
own
that
i
d
been
right
.
she
went
round
about
.
most
people
do
.
don
t
believe
in
it
myself
.
mr
.
wells
smiled
faintly
.
so
,
i
noticed
,
did
several
of
the
jury
.
miss
howard
was
obviously
quite
a
public
character
.
anyway
,
all
this
tomfoolery
is
a
great
waste
of
time
,
continued
the
lady
,
glancing
up
and
down
the
jury
disparagingly
.
talk
talk
talk
!
when
all
the
time
we
know
perfectly
well
the
coroner
interrupted
her
in
an
agony
of
apprehension
thank
you
,
miss
howard
,
that
is
all
.
i
fancy
he
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
when
she
complied
.
then
came
the
sensation
of
the
day
.
the
coroner
called
albert
mace
,
chemist
s
assistant
.
it
was
our
agitated
young
man
of
the
pale
face
.
in
answer
to
the
coroner
s
questions
,
he
explained
that
he
was
a
qualified
pharmacist
,
but
had
only
recently
come
to
this
particular
shop
,
as
the
assistant
formerly
there
had
just
been
called
up
for
the
army
.
these
preliminaries
completed
,
the
coroner
proceeded
to
business
.
mr
.
mace
,
have
you
lately
sold
strychnine
to
any
unauthorized
person
?
yes
,
sir
.
when
was
this
?
last
monday
night
.
monday
?
not
tuesday
?
no
,
sir
,
monday
,
the
th
.
will
you
tell
us
to
whom
you
sold
it
?
you
could
have
heard
a
pin
drop
.
yes
,
sir
.
it
was
to
mr
.
inglethorp
.
every
eye
turned
simultaneously
to
where
alfred
inglethorp
was
sitting
,
impassive
and
wooden
.
he
started
slightly
,
as
the
damning
words
fell
from
the
young
man
s
lips
.
i
half
thought
he
was
going
to
rise
from
his
chair
,
but
he
remained
seated
,
although
a
remarkably
well
acted
expression
of
astonishment
rose
on
his
face
.
you
are
sure
of
what
you
say
?
asked
the
coroner
sternly
.
quite
sure
,
sir
.
are
you
in
the
habit
of
selling
strychnine
indiscriminately
over
the
counter
?
the
wretched
young
man
wilted
visibly
under
the
coroner
s
frown
.
oh
,
no
,
sir
of
course
not
.
but
,
seeing
it
was
mr
.
inglethorp
of
the
hall
,
i
thought
there
was
no
harm
in
it
.
he
said
it
was
to
poison
a
dog
.
inwardly
i
sympathized
.
it
was
only
human
nature
to
endeavour
to
please
the
hall
especially
when
it
might
result
in
custom
being
transferred
from
coot
s
to
the
local
establishment
.
is
it
not
customary
for
anyone
purchasing
poison
to
sign
a
book
?
yes
,
sir
,
mr
.
inglethorp
did
so
.
have
you
got
the
book
here
?
yes
,
sir
.
it
was
produced
and
,
with
a
few
words
of
stern
censure
,
the
coroner
dismissed
the
wretched
mr
.
mace
.
then
,
amidst
a
breathless
silence
,
alfred
inglethorp
was
called
.
did
he
realize
,
i
wondered
,
how
closely
the
halter
was
being
drawn
around
his
neck
?
the
coroner
went
straight
to
the
point
.
on
monday
evening
last
,
did
you
purchase
strychnine
for
the
purpose
of
poisoning
a
dog
?
inglethorp
replied
with
perfect
calmness
no
,
i
did
not
.
there
is
no
dog
at
styles
,
except
an
outdoor
sheepdog
,
which
is
in
perfect
health
.
you
deny
absolutely
having
purchased
strychnine
from
albert
mace
on
monday
last
?
i
do
.
do
you
also
deny
this
?
the
coroner
handed
him
the
register
in
which
his
signature
was
inscribed
.
certainly
i
do
.
the
hand
writing
is
quite
different
from
mine
.
i
will
show
you
.
he
took
an
old
envelope
out
of
his
pocket
,
and
wrote
his
name
on
it
,
handing
it
to
the
jury
.
it
was
certainly
utterly
dissimilar
.
then
what
is
your
explanation
of
mr
.
mace
s
statement
?
alfred
inglethorp
replied
imperturbably
mr
.
mace
must
have
been
mistaken
.
the
coroner
hesitated
for
a
moment
,
and
then
said
mr
.
inglethorp
,
as
a
mere
matter
of
form
,
would
you
mind
telling
us
where
you
were
on
the
evening
of
monday
,
july
th
?
really
i
cannot
remember
.
that
is
absurd
,
mr
.
inglethorp
,
said
the
coroner
sharply
.
think
again
.
inglethorp
shook
his
head
.
i
cannot
tell
you
.
i
have
an
idea
that
i
was
out
walking
.
in
what
direction
?
i
really
can
t
remember
.
the
coroner
s
face
grew
graver
.
were
you
in
company
with
anyone
?
no
.
did
you
meet
anyone
on
your
walk
?
no
.
that
is
a
pity
,
said
the
coroner
dryly
.
i
am
to
take
it
then
that
you
decline
to
say
where
you
were
at
the
time
that
mr
.
mace
positively
recognized
you
as
entering
the
shop
to
purchase
strychnine
?
if
you
like
to
take
it
that
way
,
yes
.
be
careful
,
mr
.
inglethorp
.
poirot
was
fidgeting
nervously
.
sacr
!
he
murmured
.
does
this
imbecile
of
a
man
want
to
be
arrested
?
inglethorp
was
indeed
creating
a
bad
impression
.
his
futile
denials
would
not
have
convinced
a
child
.
the
coroner
,
however
,
passed
briskly
to
the
next
point
,
and
poirot
drew
a
deep
breath
of
relief
.
you
had
a
discussion
with
your
wife
on
tuesday
afternoon
?
pardon
me
,
interrupted
alfred
inglethorp
,
you
have
been
misinformed
.
i
had
no
quarrel
with
my
dear
wife
.
the
whole
story
is
absolutely
untrue
.
i
was
absent
from
the
house
the
entire
afternoon
.
have
you
anyone
who
can
testify
to
that
?
you
have
my
word
,
said
inglethorp
haughtily
.
the
coroner
did
not
trouble
to
reply
.
there
are
two
witnesses
who
will
swear
to
having
heard
your
disagreement
with
mrs
.
inglethorp
.
those
witnesses
were
mistaken
.
i
was
puzzled
.
the
man
spoke
with
such
quiet
assurance
that
i
was
staggered
.
i
looked
at
poirot
.
there
was
an
expression
of
exultation
on
his
face
which
i
could
not
understand
.
was
he
at
last
convinced
of
alfred
inglethorp
s
guilt
?
mr
.
inglethorp
,
said
the
coroner
,
you
have
heard
your
wife
s
dying
words
repeated
here
.
can
you
explain
them
in
any
way
?
certainly
i
can
.
you
can
?
it
seems
to
me
very
simple
.
the
room
was
dimly
lighted
.
dr
.
bauerstein
is
much
of
my
height
and
build
,
and
,
like
me
,
wears
a
beard
.
in
the
dim
light
,
and
suffering
as
she
was
,
my
poor
wife
mistook
him
for
me
.
ah
!
murmured
poirot
to
himself
.
but
it
is
an
idea
,
that
!
you
think
it
is
true
?
i
whispered
.
i
do
not
say
that
.
but
it
is
truly
an
ingenious
supposition
.
you
read
my
wife
s
last
words
as
an
accusation
inglethorp
was
continuing
they
were
,
on
the
contrary
,
an
appeal
to
me
.
the
coroner
reflected
a
moment
,
then
he
said
i
believe
,
mr
.
inglethorp
,
that
you
yourself
poured
out
the
coffee
,
and
took
it
to
your
wife
that
evening
?
i
poured
it
out
,
yes
.
but
i
did
not
take
it
to
her
.
i
meant
to
do
so
,
but
i
was
told
that
a
friend
was
at
the
hall
door
,
so
i
laid
down
the
coffee
on
the
hall
table
.
when
i
came
through
the
hall
again
a
few
minutes
later
,
it
was
gone
.
this
statement
might
,
or
might
not
,
be
true
,
but
it
did
not
seem
to
me
to
improve
matters
much
for
inglethorp
.
in
any
case
,
he
had
had
ample
time
to
introduce
the
poison
.
at
that
point
,
poirot
nudged
me
gently
,
indicating
two
men
who
were
sitting
together
near
the
door
.
one
was
a
little
,
sharp
,
dark
,
ferret
faced
man
,
the
other
was
tall
and
fair
.
i
questioned
poirot
mutely
.
he
put
his
lips
to
my
ear
.
do
you
know
who
that
little
man
is
?
i
shook
my
head
.
that
is
detective
inspector
james
japp
of
scotland
yard
jimmy
japp
.
the
other
man
is
from
scotland
yard
too
.
things
are
moving
quickly
,
my
friend
.
i
stared
at
the
two
men
intently
.
there
was
certainly
nothing
of
the
policeman
about
them
.
i
should
never
have
suspected
them
of
being
official
personages
.
i
was
still
staring
,
when
i
was
startled
and
recalled
by
the
verdict
being
given
wilful
murder
against
some
person
or
persons
unknown
.
chapter
vii
.
poirot
pays
his
debts
as
we
came
out
of
the
stylites
arms
,
poirot
drew
me
aside
by
a
gentle
pressure
of
the
arm
.
i
understood
his
object
.
he
was
waiting
for
the
scotland
yard
men
.
in
a
few
moments
,
they
emerged
,
and
poirot
at
once
stepped
forward
,
and
accosted
the
shorter
of
the
two
.
i
fear
you
do
not
remember
me
,
inspector
japp
.
why
,
if
it
isn
t
mr
.
poirot
!
cried
the
inspector
.
he
turned
to
the
other
man
.
you
ve
heard
me
speak
of
mr
.
poirot
?
it
was
in
he
and
i
worked
together
the
abercrombie
forgery
case
you
remember
,
he
was
run
down
in
brussels
.
ah
,
those
were
great
days
,
moosier
.
then
,
do
you
remember
baron
altara
?
there
was
a
pretty
rogue
for
you
!
he
eluded
the
clutches
of
half
the
police
in
europe
.
but
we
nailed
him
in
antwerp
thanks
to
mr
.
poirot
here
.
as
these
friendly
reminiscences
were
being
indulged
in
,
i
drew
nearer
,
and
was
introduced
to
detective
inspector
japp
,
who
,
in
his
turn
,
introduced
us
both
to
his
companion
,
superintendent
summerhaye
.
i
need
hardly
ask
what
you
are
doing
here
,
gentlemen
,
remarked
poirot
.
japp
closed
one
eye
knowingly
.
no
,
indeed
.
pretty
clear
case
i
should
say
.
but
poirot
answered
gravely
there
i
differ
from
you
.
oh
,
come
!
said
summerhaye
,
opening
his
lips
for
the
first
time
.
surely
the
whole
thing
is
clear
as
daylight
.
the
man
s
caught
red
handed
.
how
he
could
be
such
a
fool
beats
me
!
but
japp
was
looking
attentively
at
poirot
.
hold
your
fire
,
summerhaye
,
he
remarked
jocularly
.
me
and
moosier
here
have
met
before
and
there
s
no
man
s
judgment
i
d
sooner
take
than
his
.
if
i
m
not
greatly
mistaken
,
he
s
got
something
up
his
sleeve
.
isn
t
that
so
,
moosier
?
poirot
smiled
.
i
have
drawn
certain
conclusions
yes
.
summerhaye
was
still
looking
rather
sceptical
,
but
japp
continued
his
scrutiny
of
poirot
.
it
s
this
way
,
he
said
,
so
far
,
we
ve
only
seen
the
case
from
the
outside
.
that
s
where
the
yard
s
at
a
disadvantage
in
a
case
of
this
kind
,
where
the
murder
s
only
out
,
so
to
speak
,
after
the
inquest
.
a
lot
depends
on
being
on
the
spot
first
thing
,
and
that
s
where
mr
.
poirot
s
had
the
start
of
us
.
we
shouldn
t
have
been
here
as
soon
as
this
even
,
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
the
fact
that
there
was
a
smart
doctor
on
the
spot
,
who
gave
us
the
tip
through
the
coroner
.
but
you
ve
been
on
the
spot
from
the
first
,
and
you
may
have
picked
up
some
little
hints
.
from
the
evidence
at
the
inquest
,
mr
.
inglethorp
murdered
his
wife
as
sure
as
i
stand
here
,
and
if
anyone
but
you
hinted
the
contrary
i
d
laugh
in
his
face
.
i
must
say
i
was
surprised
the
jury
didn
t
bring
it
in
wilful
murder
against
him
right
off
.
i
think
they
would
have
,
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
the
coroner
he
seemed
to
be
holding
them
back
.
perhaps
,
though
,
you
have
a
warrant
for
his
arrest
in
your
pocket
now
,
suggested
poirot
.
a
kind
of
wooden
shutter
of
officialdom
came
down
from
japp
s
expressive
countenance
.
perhaps
i
have
,
and
perhaps
i
haven
t
,
he
remarked
dryly
.
poirot
looked
at
him
thoughtfully
.
i
am
very
anxious
,
messieurs
,
that
he
should
not
be
arrested
.
i
dare
say
,
observed
summerhaye
sarcastically
.
japp
was
regarding
poirot
with
comical
perplexity
.
can
t
you
go
a
little
further
,
mr
.
poirot
?
a
wink
s
as
good
as
a
nod
from
you
.
you
ve
been
on
the
spot
and
the
yard
doesn
t
want
to
make
any
mistakes
,
you
know
.
poirot
nodded
gravely
.
that
is
exactly
what
i
thought
.
well
,
i
will
tell
you
this
.
use
your
warrant
arrest
mr
.
inglethorp
.
but
it
will
bring
you
no
kudos
the
case
against
him
will
be
dismissed
at
once
!
comme
a
!
and
he
snapped
his
fingers
expressively
.
japp
s
face
grew
grave
,
though
summerhaye
gave
an
incredulous
snort
.
as
for
me
,
i
was
literally
dumb
with
astonishment
.
i
could
only
conclude
that
poirot
was
mad
.
japp
had
taken
out
a
handkerchief
,
and
was
gently
dabbing
his
brow
.
i
daren
t
do
it
,
mr
.
poirot
.
i
d
take
your
word
,
but
there
s
others
over
me
who
ll
be
asking
what
the
devil
i
mean
by
it
.
can
t
you
give
me
a
little
more
to
go
on
?
poirot
reflected
a
moment
.
it
can
be
done
,
he
said
at
last
.
i
admit
i
do
not
wish
it
.
it
forces
my
hand
.
i
would
have
preferred
to
work
in
the
dark
just
for
the
present
,
but
what
you
say
is
very
just
the
word
of
a
belgian
policeman
,
whose
day
is
past
,
is
not
enough
!
and
alfred
inglethorp
must
not
be
arrested
.
that
i
have
sworn
,
as
my
friend
hastings
here
knows
.
see
,
then
,
my
good
japp
,
you
go
at
once
to
styles
?
well
,
in
about
half
an
hour
.
we
re
seeing
the
coroner
and
the
doctor
first
.
good
.
call
for
me
in
passing
the
last
house
in
the
village
.
i
will
go
with
you
.
at
styles
,
mr
.
inglethorp
will
give
you
,
or
if
he
refuses
as
is
probable
i
will
give
you
such
proofs
that
shall
satisfy
you
that
the
case
against
him
could
not
possibly
be
sustained
.
is
that
a
bargain
?
that
s
a
bargain
,
said
japp
heartily
.
and
,
on
behalf
of
the
yard
,
i
m
much
obliged
to
you
,
though
i
m
bound
to
confess
i
can
t
at
present
see
the
faintest
possible
loop
hole
in
the
evidence
,
but
you
always
were
a
marvel
!
so
long
,
then
,
moosier
.
the
two
detectives
strode
away
,
summerhaye
with
an
incredulous
grin
on
his
face
.
well
,
my
friend
,
cried
poirot
,
before
i
could
get
in
a
word
,
what
do
you
think
?
mon
dieu
!
i
had
some
warm
moments
in
that
court
i
did
not
figure
to
myself
that
the
man
would
be
so
pig
headed
as
to
refuse
to
say
anything
at
all
.
decidedly
,
it
was
the
policy
of
an
imbecile
.
h
m
!
there
are
other
explanations
besides
that
of
imbecility
,
i
remarked
.
for
,
if
the
case
against
him
is
true
,
how
could
he
defend
himself
except
by
silence
?
why
,
in
a
thousand
ingenious
ways
,
cried
poirot
.
see
say
that
it
is
i
who
have
committed
this
murder
,
i
can
think
of
seven
most
plausible
stories
!
far
more
convincing
than
mr
.
inglethorp
s
stony
denials
!
i
could
not
help
laughing
.
my
dear
poirot
,
i
am
sure
you
are
capable
of
thinking
of
seventy
!
but
,
seriously
,
in
spite
of
what
i
heard
you
say
to
the
detectives
,
you
surely
cannot
still
believe
in
the
possibility
of
alfred
inglethorp
s
innocence
?
why
not
now
as
much
as
before
?
nothing
has
changed
.
but
the
evidence
is
so
conclusive
.
yes
,
too
conclusive
.
we
turned
in
at
the
gate
of
leastways
cottage
,
and
proceeded
up
the
now
familiar
stairs
.
yes
,
yes
,
too
conclusive
,
continued
poirot
,
almost
to
himself
.
real
evidence
is
usually
vague
and
unsatisfactory
.
it
has
to
be
examined
sifted
.
but
here
the
whole
thing
is
cut
and
dried
.
no
,
my
friend
,
this
evidence
has
been
very
cleverly
manufactured
so
cleverly
that
it
has
defeated
its
own
ends
.
how
do
you
make
that
out
?
because
,
so
long
as
the
evidence
against
him
was
vague
and
intangible
,
it
was
very
hard
to
disprove
.
but
,
in
his
anxiety
,
the
criminal
has
drawn
the
net
so
closely
that
one
cut
will
set
inglethorp
free
.
i
was
silent
.
and
in
a
minute
or
two
,
poirot
continued
let
us
look
at
the
matter
like
this
.
here
is
a
man
,
let
us
say
,
who
sets
out
to
poison
his
wife
.
he
has
lived
by
his
wits
as
the
saying
goes
.
presumably
,
therefore
,
he
has
some
wits
.
he
is
not
altogether
a
fool
.
well
,
how
does
he
set
about
it
?
he
goes
boldly
to
the
village
chemist
s
and
purchases
strychnine
under
his
own
name
,
with
a
trumped
up
story
about
a
dog
which
is
bound
to
be
proved
absurd
.
he
does
not
employ
the
poison
that
night
.
no
,
he
waits
until
he
has
had
a
violent
quarrel
with
her
,
of
which
the
whole
household
is
cognisant
,
and
which
naturally
directs
their
suspicions
upon
him
.
he
prepares
no
defence
no
shadow
of
an
alibi
,
yet
he
knows
the
chemist
s
assistant
must
necessarily
come
forward
with
the
facts
.
bah
!
do
not
ask
me
to
believe
that
any
man
could
be
so
idiotic
!
only
a
lunatic
,
who
wished
to
commit
suicide
by
causing
himself
to
be
hanged
,
would
act
so
!
still
i
do
not
see
i
began
.
neither
do
i
see
.
i
tell
you
,
mon
ami
,
it
puzzles
me
.
me
hercule
poirot
!
but
if
you
believe
him
innocent
,
how
do
you
explain
his
buying
the
strychnine
?
very
simply
.
he
did
not
buy
it
.
but
mace
recognized
him
!
i
beg
your
pardon
,
he
saw
a
man
with
a
black
beard
like
mr
.
inglethorp
s
,
and
wearing
glasses
like
mr
.
inglethorp
,
and
dressed
in
mr
.
inglethorp
s
rather
noticeable
clothes
.
he
could
not
recognize
a
man
whom
he
had
probably
only
seen
in
the
distance
,
since
,
you
remember
,
he
himself
had
only
been
in
the
village
a
fortnight
,
and
mrs
.
inglethorp
dealt
principally
with
coot
s
in
tadminster
.
then
you
think
mon
ami
,
do
you
remember
the
two
points
i
laid
stress
upon
?
leave
the
first
one
for
the
moment
,
what
was
the
second
?
the
important
fact
that
alfred
inglethorp
wears
peculiar
clothes
,
has
a
black
beard
,
and
uses
glasses
,
i
quoted
.
exactly
.
now
suppose
anyone
wished
to
pass
himself
off
as
john
or
lawrence
cavendish
.
would
it
be
easy
?
no
,
i
said
thoughtfully
.
of
course
an
actor
but
poirot
cut
me
short
ruthlessly
.
and
why
would
it
not
be
easy
?
i
will
tell
you
,
my
friend
because
they
are
both
clean
shaven
men
.
to
make
up
successfully
as
one
of
these
two
in
broad
daylight
,
it
would
need
an
actor
of
genius
,
and
a
certain
initial
facial
resemblance
.
but
in
the
case
of
alfred
inglethorp
,
all
that
is
changed
.
his
clothes
,
his
beard
,
the
glasses
which
hide
his
eyes
those
are
the
salient
points
about
his
personal
appearance
.
now
,
what
is
the
first
instinct
of
the
criminal
?
to
divert
suspicion
from
himself
,
is
it
not
so
?
and
how
can
he
best
do
that
?
by
throwing
it
on
someone
else
.
in
this
instance
,
there
was
a
man
ready
to
his
hand
.
everybody
was
predisposed
to
believe
in
mr
.
inglethorp
s
guilt
.
it
was
a
foregone
conclusion
that
he
would
be
suspected
but
,
to
make
it
a
sure
thing
there
must
be
tangible
proof
such
as
the
actual
buying
of
the
poison
,
and
that
,
with
a
man
of
the
peculiar
appearance
of
mr
.
inglethorp
,
was
not
difficult
.
remember
,
this
young
mace
had
never
actually
spoken
to
mr
.
inglethorp
.
how
should
he
doubt
that
the
man
in
his
clothes
,
with
his
beard
and
his
glasses
,
was
not
alfred
inglethorp
?
it
may
be
so
,
i
said
,
fascinated
by
poirot
s
eloquence
.
but
,
if
that
was
the
case
,
why
does
he
not
say
where
he
was
at
six
o
clock
on
monday
evening
?
ah
,
why
indeed
?
said
poirot
,
calming
down
.
if
he
were
arrested
,
he
probably
would
speak
,
but
i
do
not
want
it
to
come
to
that
.
i
must
make
him
see
the
gravity
of
his
position
.
there
is
,
of
course
,
something
discreditable
behind
his
silence
.
if
he
did
not
murder
his
wife
,
he
is
,
nevertheless
,
a
scoundrel
,
and
has
something
of
his
own
to
conceal
,
quite
apart
from
the
murder
.
what
can
it
be
?
i
mused
,
won
over
to
poirot
s
views
for
the
moment
,
although
still
retaining
a
faint
conviction
that
the
obvious
deduction
was
the
correct
one
.
can
you
not
guess
?
asked
poirot
,
smiling
.
no
,
can
you
?
oh
,
yes
,
i
had
a
little
idea
sometime
ago
and
it
has
turned
out
to
be
correct
.
you
never
told
me
,
i
said
reproachfully
.
poirot
spread
out
his
hands
apologetically
.
pardon
me
,
mon
ami
,
you
were
not
precisely
sympathique
.
he
turned
to
me
earnestly
.
tell
me
you
see
now
that
he
must
not
be
arrested
?
perhaps
,
i
said
doubtfully
,
for
i
was
really
quite
indifferent
to
the
fate
of
alfred
inglethorp
,
and
thought
that
a
good
fright
would
do
him
no
harm
.
poirot
,
who
was
watching
me
intently
,
gave
a
sigh
.
come
,
my
friend
,
he
said
,
changing
the
subject
,
apart
from
mr
.
inglethorp
,
how
did
the
evidence
at
the
inquest
strike
you
?
oh
,
pretty
much
what
i
expected
.
did
nothing
strike
you
as
peculiar
about
it
?
my
thoughts
flew
to
mary
cavendish
,
and
i
hedged
in
what
way
?
well
,
mr
.
lawrence
cavendish
s
evidence
for
instance
?
i
was
relieved
.
oh
,
lawrence
!
no
,
i
don
t
think
so
.
he
s
always
a
nervous
chap
.
his
suggestion
that
his
mother
might
have
been
poisoned
accidentally
by
means
of
the
tonic
she
was
taking
,
that
did
not
strike
you
as
strange
hein
?
no
,
i
can
t
say
it
did
.
the
doctors
ridiculed
it
of
course
.
but
it
was
quite
a
natural
suggestion
for
a
layman
to
make
.
but
monsieur
lawrence
is
not
a
layman
.
you
told
me
yourself
that
he
had
started
by
studying
medicine
,
and
that
he
had
taken
his
degree
.
yes
,
that
s
true
.
i
never
thought
of
that
.
i
was
rather
startled
.
it
is
odd
.
poirot
nodded
.
from
the
first
,
his
behaviour
has
been
peculiar
.
of
all
the
household
,
he
alone
would
be
likely
to
recognize
the
symptoms
of
strychnine
poisoning
,
and
yet
we
find
him
the
only
member
of
the
family
to
uphold
strenuously
the
theory
of
death
from
natural
causes
.
if
it
had
been
monsieur
john
,
i
could
have
understood
it
.
he
has
no
technical
knowledge
,
and
is
by
nature
unimaginative
.
but
monsieur
lawrence
no
!
and
now
,
to
day
,
he
puts
forward
a
suggestion
that
he
himself
must
have
known
was
ridiculous
.
there
is
food
for
thought
in
this
,
mon
ami
!
it
s
very
confusing
,
i
agreed
.
then
there
is
mrs
.
cavendish
,
continued
poirot
.
that
s
another
who
is
not
telling
all
she
knows
!
what
do
you
make
of
her
attitude
?
i
don
t
know
what
to
make
of
it
.
it
seems
inconceivable
that
she
should
be
shielding
alfred
inglethorp
.
yet
that
is
what
it
looks
like
.
poirot
nodded
reflectively
.
yes
,
it
is
queer
.
one
thing
is
certain
,
she
overheard
a
good
deal
more
of
that
private
conversation
than
she
was
willing
to
admit
.
and
yet
she
is
the
last
person
one
would
accuse
of
stooping
to
eavesdrop
!
exactly
.
one
thing
her
evidence
has
shown
me
.
i
made
a
mistake
.
dorcas
was
quite
right
.
the
quarrel
did
take
place
earlier
in
the
afternoon
,
about
four
o
clock
,
as
she
said
.
i
looked
at
him
curiously
.
i
had
never
understood
his
insistence
on
that
point
.
yes
,
a
good
deal
that
was
peculiar
came
out
to
day
,
continued
poirot
.
dr
.
bauerstein
,
now
,
what
was
he
doing
up
and
dressed
at
that
hour
in
the
morning
?
it
is
astonishing
to
me
that
no
one
commented
on
the
fact
.
he
has
insomnia
,
i
believe
,
i
said
doubtfully
.
which
is
a
very
good
,
or
a
very
bad
explanation
,
remarked
poirot
.
it
covers
everything
,
and
explains
nothing
.
i
shall
keep
my
eye
on
our
clever
dr
.
bauerstein
.
any
more
faults
to
find
with
the
evidence
?
i
inquired
satirically
.
mon
ami
,
replied
poirot
gravely
,
when
you
find
that
people
are
not
telling
you
the
truth
look
out
!
now
,
unless
i
am
much
mistaken
,
at
the
inquest
to
day
only
one
at
most
,
two
persons
were
speaking
the
truth
without
reservation
or
subterfuge
.
oh
,
come
now
,
poirot
!
i
won
t
cite
lawrence
,
or
mrs
.
cavendish
.
but
there
s
john
and
miss
howard
,
surely
they
were
speaking
the
truth
?
both
of
them
,
my
friend
?
one
,
i
grant
you
,
but
both
!
his
words
gave
me
an
unpleasant
shock
.
miss
howard
s
evidence
,
unimportant
as
it
was
,
had
been
given
in
such
a
downright
straightforward
manner
that
it
had
never
occurred
to
me
to
doubt
her
sincerity
.
still
,
i
had
a
great
respect
for
poirot
s
sagacity
except
on
the
occasions
when
he
was
what
i
described
to
myself
as
foolishly
pig
headed
.
do
you
really
think
so
?
i
asked
.
miss
howard
had
always
seemed
to
me
so
essentially
honest
almost
uncomfortably
so
.
poirot
gave
me
a
curious
look
,
which
i
could
not
quite
fathom
.
he
seemed
to
speak
,
and
then
checked
himself
.
miss
murdoch
too
,
i
continued
,
there
s
nothing
untruthful
about
her
.
no
.
but
it
was
strange
that
she
never
heard
a
sound
,
sleeping
next
door
whereas
mrs
.
cavendish
,
in
the
other
wing
of
the
building
,
distinctly
heard
the
table
fall
.
well
,
she
s
young
.
and
she
sleeps
soundly
.
ah
,
yes
,
indeed
!
she
must
be
a
famous
sleeper
,
that
one
!
i
did
not
quite
like
the
tone
of
his
voice
,
but
at
that
moment
a
smart
knock
reached
our
ears
,
and
looking
out
of
the
window
we
perceived
the
two
detectives
waiting
for
us
below
.
poirot
seized
his
hat
,
gave
a
ferocious
twist
to
his
moustache
,
and
,
carefully
brushing
an
imaginary
speck
of
dust
from
his
sleeve
,
motioned
me
to
precede
him
down
the
stairs
there
we
joined
the
detectives
and
set
out
for
styles
.
i
think
the
appearance
of
the
two
scotland
yard
men
was
rather
a
shock
especially
to
john
,
though
of
course
after
the
verdict
,
he
had
realized
that
it
was
only
a
matter
of
time
.
still
,
the
presence
of
the
detectives
brought
the
truth
home
to
him
more
than
anything
else
could
have
done
.
poirot
had
conferred
with
japp
in
a
low
tone
on
the
way
up
,
and
it
was
the
latter
functionary
who
requested
that
the
household
,
with
the
exception
of
the
servants
,
should
be
assembled
together
in
the
drawing
room
.
i
realized
the
significance
of
this
.
it
was
up
to
poirot
to
make
his
boast
good
.
personally
,
i
was
not
sanguine
.
poirot
might
have
excellent
reasons
for
his
belief
in
inglethorp
s
innocence
,
but
a
man
of
the
type
of
summerhaye
would
require
tangible
proofs
,
and
these
i
doubted
if
poirot
could
supply
.
before
very
long
we
had
all
trooped
into
the
drawing
room
,
the
door
of
which
japp
closed
.
poirot
politely
set
chairs
for
everyone
.
the
scotland
yard
men
were
the
cynosure
of
all
eyes
.
i
think
that
for
the
first
time
we
realized
that
the
thing
was
not
a
bad
dream
,
but
a
tangible
reality
.
we
had
read
of
such
things
now
we
ourselves
were
actors
in
the
drama
.
to
morrow
the
daily
papers
,
all
over
england
,
would
blazon
out
the
news
in
staring
headlines
mysterious
tragedy
in
essex
wealthy
lady
poisoned
there
would
be
pictures
of
styles
,
snap
shots
of
the
family
leaving
the
inquest
the
village
photographer
had
not
been
idle
!
all
the
things
that
one
had
read
a
hundred
times
things
that
happen
to
other
people
,
not
to
oneself
.
and
now
,
in
this
house
,
a
murder
had
been
committed
.
in
front
of
us
were
the
detectives
in
charge
of
the
case
.
the
well
known
glib
phraseology
passed
rapidly
through
my
mind
in
the
interval
before
poirot
opened
the
proceedings
.
i
think
everyone
was
a
little
surprised
that
it
should
be
he
and
not
one
of
the
official
detectives
who
took
the
initiative
.
mesdames
and
messieurs
,
said
poirot
,
bowing
as
though
he
were
a
celebrity
about
to
deliver
a
lecture
,
i
have
asked
you
to
come
here
all
together
,
for
a
certain
object
.
that
object
,
it
concerns
mr
.
alfred
inglethorp
.
inglethorp
was
sitting
a
little
by
himself
i
think
,
unconsciously
,
everyone
had
drawn
his
chair
slightly
away
from
him
and
he
gave
a
faint
start
as
poirot
pronounced
his
name
.
mr
.
inglethorp
,
said
poirot
,
addressing
him
directly
,
a
very
dark
shadow
is
resting
on
this
house
the
shadow
of
murder
.
inglethorp
shook
his
head
sadly
.
my
poor
wife
,
he
murmured
.
poor
emily
!
it
is
terrible
.
i
do
not
think
,
monsieur
,
said
poirot
pointedly
,
that
you
quite
realize
how
terrible
it
may
be
for
you
.
and
as
inglethorp
did
not
appear
to
understand
,
he
added
mr
.
inglethorp
,
you
are
standing
in
very
grave
danger
.
the
two
detectives
fidgeted
.
i
saw
the
official
caution
anything
you
say
will
be
used
in
evidence
against
you
,
actually
hovering
on
summerhaye
s
lips
.
poirot
went
on
.
do
you
understand
now
,
monsieur
?
no
.
what
do
you
mean
?
i
mean
,
said
poirot
deliberately
,
that
you
are
suspected
of
poisoning
your
wife
.
a
little
gasp
ran
round
the
circle
at
this
plain
speaking
.
good
heavens
!
cried
inglethorp
,
starting
up
.
what
a
monstrous
idea
!
i
poison
my
dearest
emily
!
i
do
not
think
poirot
watched
him
narrowly
that
you
quite
realize
the
unfavourable
nature
of
your
evidence
at
the
inquest
.
mr
.
inglethorp
,
knowing
what
i
have
now
told
you
,
do
you
still
refuse
to
say
where
you
were
at
six
o
clock
on
monday
afternoon
?
with
a
groan
,
alfred
inglethorp
sank
down
again
and
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
.
poirot
approached
and
stood
over
him
.
speak
!
he
cried
menacingly
.
with
an
effort
,
inglethorp
raised
his
face
from
his
hands
.
then
,
slowly
and
deliberately
,
he
shook
his
head
.
you
will
not
speak
?
no
.
i
do
not
believe
that
anyone
could
be
so
monstrous
as
to
accuse
me
of
what
you
say
.
poirot
nodded
thoughtfully
,
like
a
man
whose
mind
is
made
up
.
soit
!
he
said
.
then
i
must
speak
for
you
.
alfred
inglethorp
sprang
up
again
.
you
?
how
can
you
speak
?
you
do
not
know
he
broke
off
abruptly
.
poirot
turned
to
face
us
.
mesdames
and
messieurs
!
i
speak
!
listen
!
i
,
hercule
poirot
,
affirm
that
the
man
who
entered
the
chemist
s
shop
,
and
purchased
strychnine
at
six
o
clock
on
monday
last
was
not
mr
.
inglethorp
,
for
at
six
o
clock
on
that
day
mr
.
inglethorp
was
escorting
mrs
.
raikes
back
to
her
home
from
a
neighbouring
farm
.
i
can
produce
no
less
than
five
witnesses
to
swear
to
having
seen
them
together
,
either
at
six
or
just
after
and
,
as
you
may
know
,
the
abbey
farm
,
mrs
.
raikes
s
home
,
is
at
least
two
and
a
half
miles
distant
from
the
village
.
there
is
absolutely
no
question
as
to
the
alibi
!
chapter
viii
.
fresh
suspicions
there
was
a
moment
s
stupefied
silence
.
japp
,
who
was
the
least
surprised
of
any
of
us
,
was
the
first
to
speak
.
my
word
,
he
cried
,
you
re
the
goods
!
and
no
mistake
,
mr
.
poirot
!
these
witnesses
of
yours
are
all
right
,
i
suppose
?
voil
!
i
have
prepared
a
list
of
them
names
and
addresses
.
you
must
see
them
,
of
course
.
but
you
will
find
it
all
right
.
i
m
sure
of
that
.
japp
lowered
his
voice
.
i
m
much
obliged
to
you
.
a
pretty
mare
s
nest
arresting
him
would
have
been
.
he
turned
to
inglethorp
.
but
,
if
you
ll
excuse
me
,
sir
,
why
couldn
t
you
say
all
this
at
the
inquest
?
i
will
tell
you
why
,
interrupted
poirot
.
there
was
a
certain
rumour
a
most
malicious
and
utterly
untrue
one
,
interrupted
alfred
inglethorp
in
an
agitated
voice
.
and
mr
.
inglethorp
was
anxious
to
have
no
scandal
revived
just
at
present
.
am
i
right
?
quite
right
.
inglethorp
nodded
.
with
my
poor
emily
not
yet
buried
,
can
you
wonder
i
was
anxious
that
no
more
lying
rumours
should
be
started
.
between
you
and
me
,
sir
,
remarked
japp
,
i
d
sooner
have
any
amount
of
rumours
than
be
arrested
for
murder
.
and
i
venture
to
think
your
poor
lady
would
have
felt
the
same
.
and
,
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
mr
.
poirot
here
,
arrested
you
would
have
been
,
as
sure
as
eggs
is
eggs
!
i
was
foolish
,
no
doubt
,
murmured
inglethorp
.
but
you
do
not
know
,
inspector
,
how
i
have
been
persecuted
and
maligned
.
and
he
shot
a
baleful
glance
at
evelyn
howard
.
now
,
sir
,
said
japp
,
turning
briskly
to
john
,
i
should
like
to
see
the
lady
s
bedroom
,
please
,
and
after
that
i
ll
have
a
little
chat
with
the
servants
.
don
t
you
bother
about
anything
.
mr
.
poirot
,
here
,
will
show
me
the
way
.
as
they
all
went
out
of
the
room
,
poirot
turned
and
made
me
a
sign
to
follow
him
upstairs
.
there
he
caught
me
by
the
arm
,
and
drew
me
aside
.
quick
,
go
to
the
other
wing
.
stand
there
just
this
side
of
the
baize
door
.
do
not
move
till
i
come
.
then
,
turning
rapidly
,
he
rejoined
the
two
detectives
.
i
followed
his
instructions
,
taking
up
my
position
by
the
baize
door
,
and
wondering
what
on
earth
lay
behind
the
request
.
why
was
i
to
stand
in
this
particular
spot
on
guard
?
i
looked
thoughtfully
down
the
corridor
in
front
of
me
.
an
idea
struck
me
.
with
the
exception
of
cynthia
murdoch
s
,
everyone
s
room
was
in
this
left
wing
.
had
that
anything
to
do
with
it
?
was
i
to
report
who
came
or
went
?
i
stood
faithfully
at
my
post
.
the
minutes
passed
.
nobody
came
.
nothing
happened
.
it
must
have
been
quite
twenty
minutes
before
poirot
rejoined
me
.
you
have
not
stirred
?
no
,
i
ve
stuck
here
like
a
rock
.
nothing
s
happened
.
ah
!
was
he
pleased
,
or
disappointed
?
you
ve
seen
nothing
at
all
?
no
.
but
you
have
probably
heard
something
?
a
big
bump
eh
,
mon
ami
?
no
.
is
it
possible
?
ah
,
but
i
am
vexed
with
myself
!
i
am
not
usually
clumsy
.
i
made
but
a
slight
gesture
i
know
poirot
s
gestures
with
the
left
hand
,
and
over
went
the
table
by
the
bed
!
he
looked
so
childishly
vexed
and
crest
fallen
that
i
hastened
to
console
him
.
never
mind
,
old
chap
.
what
does
it
matter
?
your
triumph
downstairs
excited
you
.
i
can
tell
you
,
that
was
a
surprise
to
us
all
.
there
must
be
more
in
this
affair
of
inglethorp
s
with
mrs
.
raikes
than
we
thought
,
to
make
him
hold
his
tongue
so
persistently
.
what
are
you
going
to
do
now
?
where
are
the
scotland
yard
fellows
?
gone
down
to
interview
the
servants
.
i
showed
them
all
our
exhibits
.
i
am
disappointed
in
japp
.
he
has
no
method
!
hullo
!
i
said
,
looking
out
of
the
window
.
here
s
dr
.
bauerstein
.
i
believe
you
re
right
about
that
man
,
poirot
.
i
don
t
like
him
.
he
is
clever
,
observed
poirot
meditatively
.
oh
,
clever
as
the
devil
!
i
must
say
i
was
overjoyed
to
see
him
in
the
plight
he
was
in
on
tuesday
.
you
never
saw
such
a
spectacle
!
and
i
described
the
doctor
s
adventure
.
he
looked
a
regular
scarecrow
!
plastered
with
mud
from
head
to
foot
.
you
saw
him
,
then
?
yes
.
of
course
,
he
didn
t
want
to
come
in
it
was
just
after
dinner
but
mr
.
inglethorp
insisted
.
what
?
poirot
caught
me
violently
by
the
shoulders
.
was
dr
.
bauerstein
here
on
tuesday
evening
?
here
?
and
you
never
told
me
?
why
did
you
not
tell
me
?
why
?
why
?
he
appeared
to
be
in
an
absolute
frenzy
.
my
dear
poirot
,
i
expostulated
,
i
never
thought
it
would
interest
you
.
i
didn
t
know
it
was
of
any
importance
.
importance
?
it
is
of
the
first
importance
!
so
dr
.
bauerstein
was
here
on
tuesday
night
the
night
of
the
murder
.
hastings
,
do
you
not
see
?
that
alters
everything
everything
!
i
had
never
seen
him
so
upset
.
loosening
his
hold
of
me
,
he
mechanically
straightened
a
pair
of
candlesticks
,
still
murmuring
to
himself
yes
,
that
alters
everything
everything
.
suddenly
he
seemed
to
come
to
a
decision
.
allons
!
he
said
.
we
must
act
at
once
.
where
is
mr
.
cavendish
?
john
was
in
the
smoking
room
.
poirot
went
straight
to
him
.
mr
.
cavendish
,
i
have
some
important
business
in
tadminster
.
a
new
clue
.
may
i
take
your
motor
?
why
,
of
course
.
do
you
mean
at
once
?
if
you
please
.
john
rang
the
bell
,
and
ordered
round
the
car
.
in
another
ten
minutes
,
we
were
racing
down
the
park
and
along
the
high
road
to
tadminster
.
now
,
poirot
,
i
remarked
resignedly
,
perhaps
you
will
tell
me
what
all
this
is
about
?
well
,
mon
ami
,
a
good
deal
you
can
guess
for
yourself
.
of
course
you
realize
that
,
now
mr
.
inglethorp
is
out
of
it
,
the
whole
position
is
greatly
changed
.
we
are
face
to
face
with
an
entirely
new
problem
.
we
know
now
that
there
is
one
person
who
did
not
buy
the
poison
.
we
have
cleared
away
the
manufactured
clues
.
now
for
the
real
ones
.
i
have
ascertained
that
anyone
in
the
household
,
with
the
exception
of
mrs
.
cavendish
,
who
was
playing
tennis
with
you
,
could
have
personated
mr
.
inglethorp
on
monday
evening
.
in
the
same
way
,
we
have
his
statement
that
he
put
the
coffee
down
in
the
hall
.
no
one
took
much
notice
of
that
at
the
inquest
but
now
it
has
a
very
different
significance
.
we
must
find
out
who
did
take
that
coffee
to
mrs
.
inglethorp
eventually
,
or
who
passed
through
the
hall
whilst
it
was
standing
there
.
from
your
account
,
there
are
only
two
people
whom
we
can
positively
say
did
not
go
near
the
coffee
mrs
.
cavendish
,
and
mademoiselle
cynthia
.
yes
,
that
is
so
.
i
felt
an
inexpressible
lightening
of
the
heart
.
mary
cavendish
could
certainly
not
rest
under
suspicion
.
in
clearing
alfred
inglethorp
,
continued
poirot
,
i
have
been
obliged
to
show
my
hand
sooner
than
i
intended
.
as
long
as
i
might
be
thought
to
be
pursuing
him
,
the
criminal
would
be
off
his
guard
.
now
,
he
will
be
doubly
careful
.
yes
doubly
careful
.
he
turned
to
me
abruptly
.
tell
me
,
hastings
,
you
yourself
have
you
no
suspicions
of
anybody
?
i
hesitated
.
to
tell
the
truth
,
an
idea
,
wild
and
extravagant
in
itself
,
had
once
or
twice
that
morning
flashed
through
my
brain
.
i
had
rejected
it
as
absurd
,
nevertheless
it
persisted
.
you
couldn
t
call
it
a
suspicion
,
i
murmured
.
it
s
so
utterly
foolish
.
come
now
,
urged
poirot
encouragingly
.
do
not
fear
.
speak
your
mind
.
you
should
always
pay
attention
to
your
instincts
.
well
then
,
i
blurted
out
,
it
s
absurd
but
i
suspect
miss
howard
of
not
telling
all
she
knows
!
miss
howard
?
yes
you
ll
laugh
at
me
not
at
all
.
why
should
i
?
i
can
t
help
feeling
,
i
continued
blunderingly
that
we
ve
rather
left
her
out
of
the
possible
suspects
,
simply
on
the
strength
of
her
having
been
away
from
the
place
.
but
,
after
all
,
she
was
only
fifteen
miles
away
.
a
car
would
do
it
in
half
an
hour
.
can
we
say
positively
that
she
was
away
from
styles
on
the
night
of
the
murder
?
yes
,
my
friend
,
said
poirot
unexpectedly
,
we
can
.
one
of
my
first
actions
was
to
ring
up
the
hospital
where
she
was
working
.
well
?
well
,
i
learnt
that
miss
howard
had
been
on
afternoon
duty
on
tuesday
,
and
that
a
convoy
coming
in
unexpectedly
she
had
kindly
offered
to
remain
on
night
duty
,
which
offer
was
gratefully
accepted
.
that
disposes
of
that
.
oh
!
i
said
,
rather
nonplussed
.
really
,
i
continued
,
it
s
her
extraordinary
vehemence
against
inglethorp
that
started
me
off
suspecting
her
.
i
can
t
help
feeling
she
d
do
anything
against
him
.
and
i
had
an
idea
she
might
know
something
about
the
destroying
of
the
will
.
she
might
have
burnt
the
new
one
,
mistaking
it
for
the
earlier
one
in
his
favour
.
she
is
so
terribly
bitter
against
him
.
you
consider
her
vehemence
unnatural
?
y
es
.
she
is
so
very
violent
.
i
wondered
really
whether
she
is
quite
sane
on
that
point
.
poirot
shook
his
head
energetically
.
no
,
no
,
you
are
on
a
wrong
tack
there
.
there
is
nothing
weak
minded
or
degenerate
about
miss
howard
.
she
is
an
excellent
specimen
of
well
balanced
english
beef
and
brawn
.
she
is
sanity
itself
.
yet
her
hatred
of
inglethorp
seems
almost
a
mania
.
my
idea
was
a
very
ridiculous
one
,
no
doubt
that
she
had
intended
to
poison
him
and
that
,
in
some
way
,
mrs
.
inglethorp
got
hold
of
it
by
mistake
.
but
i
don
t
at
all
see
how
it
could
have
been
done
.
the
whole
thing
is
absurd
and
ridiculous
to
the
last
degree
.
still
you
are
right
in
one
thing
.
it
is
always
wise
to
suspect
everybody
until
you
can
prove
logically
,
and
to
your
own
satisfaction
,
that
they
are
innocent
.
now
,
what
reasons
are
there
against
miss
howard
s
having
deliberately
poisoned
mrs
.
inglethorp
?
why
,
she
was
devoted
to
her
!
i
exclaimed
.
tcha
!
tcha
!
cried
poirot
irritably
.
you
argue
like
a
child
.
if
miss
howard
were
capable
of
poisoning
the
old
lady
,
she
would
be
quite
equally
capable
of
simulating
devotion
.
no
,
we
must
look
elsewhere
.
you
are
perfectly
correct
in
your
assumption
that
her
vehemence
against
alfred
inglethorp
is
too
violent
to
be
natural
but
you
are
quite
wrong
in
the
deduction
you
draw
from
it
.
i
have
drawn
my
own
deductions
,
which
i
believe
to
be
correct
,
but
i
will
not
speak
of
them
at
present
.
he
paused
a
minute
,
then
went
on
.
now
,
to
my
way
of
thinking
,
there
is
one
insuperable
objection
to
miss
howard
s
being
the
murderess
.
and
that
is
?
that
in
no
possible
way
could
mrs
.
inglethorp
s
death
benefit
miss
howard
.
now
there
is
no
murder
without
a
motive
.
i
reflected
.
could
not
mrs
.
inglethorp
have
made
a
will
in
her
favour
?
poirot
shook
his
head
.
but
you
yourself
suggested
that
possibility
to
mr
.
wells
?
poirot
smiled
.
that
was
for
a
reason
.
i
did
not
want
to
mention
the
name
of
the
person
who
was
actually
in
my
mind
.
miss
howard
occupied
very
much
the
same
position
,
so
i
used
her
name
instead
.
still
,
mrs
.
inglethorp
might
have
done
so
.
why
,
that
will
,
made
on
the
afternoon
of
her
death
may
but
poirot
s
shake
of
the
head
was
so
energetic
that
i
stopped
.
no
,
my
friend
.
i
have
certain
little
ideas
of
my
own
about
that
will
.
but
i
can
tell
you
this
much
it
was
not
in
miss
howard
s
favour
.
i
accepted
his
assurance
,
though
i
did
not
really
see
how
he
could
be
so
positive
about
the
matter
.
well
,
i
said
,
with
a
sigh
,
we
will
acquit
miss
howard
,
then
.
it
is
partly
your
fault
that
i
ever
came
to
suspect
her
.
it
was
what
you
said
about
her
evidence
at
the
inquest
that
set
me
off
.
poirot
looked
puzzled
.
what
did
i
say
about
her
evidence
at
the
inquest
?
don
t
you
remember
?
when
i
cited
her
and
john
cavendish
as
being
above
suspicion
?
oh
ah
yes
.
he
seemed
a
little
confused
,
but
recovered
himself
.
by
the
way
,
hastings
,
there
is
something
i
want
you
to
do
for
me
.
certainly
.
what
is
it
?
next
time
you
happen
to
be
alone
with
lawrence
cavendish
,
i
want
you
to
say
this
to
him
.
i
have
a
message
for
you
,
from
poirot
.
he
says
find
the
extra
coffee
cup
,
and
you
can
rest
in
peace
!
nothing
more
.
nothing
less
.
find
the
extra
coffee
cup
,
and
you
can
rest
in
peace
.
is
that
right
?
i
asked
,
much
mystified
.
excellent
.
but
what
does
it
mean
?
ah
,
that
i
will
leave
you
to
find
out
.
you
have
access
to
the
facts
.
just
say
that
to
him
,
and
see
what
he
says
.
very
well
but
it
s
all
extremely
mysterious
.
we
were
running
into
tadminster
now
,
and
poirot
directed
the
car
to
the
analytical
chemist
.
poirot
hopped
down
briskly
,
and
went
inside
.
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
back
again
.
there
,
he
said
.
that
is
all
my
business
.
what
were
you
doing
there
?
i
asked
,
in
lively
curiosity
.
i
left
something
to
be
analysed
.
yes
,
but
what
?
the
sample
of
cocoa
i
took
from
the
saucepan
in
the
bedroom
.
but
that
has
already
been
tested
!
i
cried
,
stupefied
.
dr
.
bauerstein
had
it
tested
,
and
you
yourself
laughed
at
the
possibility
of
there
being
strychnine
in
it
.
i
know
dr
.
bauerstein
had
it
tested
,
replied
poirot
quietly
.
well
,
then
?
well
,
i
have
a
fancy
for
having
it
analysed
again
,
that
is
all
.
and
not
another
word
on
the
subject
could
i
drag
out
of
him
.
this
proceeding
of
poirot
s
,
in
respect
of
the
cocoa
,
puzzled
me
intensely
.
i
could
see
neither
rhyme
nor
reason
in
it
.
however
,
my
confidence
in
him
,
which
at
one
time
had
rather
waned
,
was
fully
restored
since
his
belief
in
alfred
inglethorp
s
innocence
had
been
so
triumphantly
vindicated
.
the
funeral
of
mrs
.
inglethorp
took
place
the
following
day
,
and
on
monday
,
as
i
came
down
to
a
late
breakfast
,
john
drew
me
aside
,
and
informed
me
that
mr
.
inglethorp
was
leaving
that
morning
,
to
take
up
his
quarters
at
the
stylites
arms
until
he
should
have
completed
his
plans
.
and
really
it
s
a
great
relief
to
think
he
s
going
,
hastings
,
continued
my
honest
friend
.
it
was
bad
enough
before
,
when
we
thought
he
d
done
it
,
but
i
m
hanged
if
it
isn
t
worse
now
,
when
we
all
feel
guilty
for
having
been
so
down
on
the
fellow
.
the
fact
is
,
we
ve
treated
him
abominably
.
of
course
,
things
did
look
black
against
him
.
i
don
t
see
how
anyone
could
blame
us
for
jumping
to
the
conclusions
we
did
.
still
,
there
it
is
,
we
were
in
the
wrong
,
and
now
there
s
a
beastly
feeling
that
one
ought
to
make
amends
which
is
difficult
,
when
one
doesn
t
like
the
fellow
a
bit
better
than
one
did
before
.
the
whole
thing
s
damned
awkward
!
and
i
m
thankful
he
s
had
the
tact
to
take
himself
off
.
it
s
a
good
thing
styles
wasn
t
the
mater
s
to
leave
to
him
.
couldn
t
bear
to
think
of
the
fellow
lording
it
here
.
he
s
welcome
to
her
money
.
you
ll
be
able
to
keep
up
the
place
all
right
?
i
asked
.
oh
,
yes
.
there
are
the
death
duties
,
of
course
,
but
half
my
father
s
money
goes
with
the
place
,
and
lawrence
will
stay
with
us
for
the
present
,
so
there
is
his
share
as
well
.
we
shall
be
pinched
at
first
,
of
course
,
because
,
as
i
once
told
you
,
i
am
in
a
bit
of
a
hole
financially
myself
.
still
,
the
johnnies
will
wait
now
.
in
the
general
relief
at
inglethorp
s
approaching
departure
,
we
had
the
most
genial
breakfast
we
had
experienced
since
the
tragedy
.
cynthia
,
whose
young
spirits
were
naturally
buoyant
,
was
looking
quite
her
pretty
self
again
,
and
we
all
,
with
the
exception
of
lawrence
,
who
seemed
unalterably
gloomy
and
nervous
,
were
quietly
cheerful
,
at
the
opening
of
a
new
and
hopeful
future
.
the
papers
,
of
course
,
had
been
full
of
the
tragedy
.
glaring
headlines
,
sandwiched
biographies
of
every
member
of
the
household
,
subtle
innuendoes
,
the
usual
familiar
tag
about
the
police
having
a
clue
.
nothing
was
spared
us
.
it
was
a
slack
time
.
the
war
was
momentarily
inactive
,
and
the
newspapers
seized
with
avidity
on
this
crime
in
fashionable
life
the
mysterious
affair
at
styles
was
the
topic
of
the
moment
.
naturally
it
was
very
annoying
for
the
cavendishes
.
the
house
was
constantly
besieged
by
reporters
,
who
were
consistently
denied
admission
,
but
who
continued
to
haunt
the
village
and
the
grounds
,
where
they
lay
in
wait
with
cameras
,
for
any
unwary
members
of
the
household
.
we
all
lived
in
a
blast
of
publicity
.
the
scotland
yard
men
came
and
went
,
examining
,
questioning
,
lynx
eyed
and
reserved
of
tongue
.
towards
what
end
they
were
working
,
we
did
not
know
.
had
they
any
clue
,
or
would
the
whole
thing
remain
in
the
category
of
undiscovered
crimes
?
after
breakfast
,
dorcas
came
up
to
me
rather
mysteriously
,
and
asked
if
she
might
have
a
few
words
with
me
.
certainly
.
what
is
it
,
dorcas
?
well
,
it
s
just
this
,
sir
.
you
ll
be
seeing
the
belgian
gentleman
to
day
perhaps
?
i
nodded
.
well
,
sir
,
you
know
how
he
asked
me
so
particular
if
the
mistress
,
or
anyone
else
,
had
a
green
dress
?
yes
,
yes
.
you
have
found
one
?
my
interest
was
aroused
.
no
,
not
that
,
sir
.
but
since
then
i
ve
remembered
what
the
young
gentlemen
john
and
lawrence
were
still
the
young
gentlemen
to
dorcas
call
the
dressing
up
box
.
it
s
up
in
the
front
attic
,
sir
.
a
great
chest
,
full
of
old
clothes
and
fancy
dresses
,
and
what
not
.
and
it
came
to
me
sudden
like
that
there
might
be
a
green
dress
amongst
them
.
so
,
if
you
d
tell
the
belgian
gentleman
i
will
tell
him
,
dorcas
,
i
promised
.
thank
you
very
much
,
sir
.
a
very
nice
gentleman
he
is
,
sir
.
and
quite
a
different
class
from
them
two
detectives
from
london
,
what
goes
prying
about
,
and
asking
questions
.
i
don
t
hold
with
foreigners
as
a
rule
,
but
from
what
the
newspapers
say
i
make
out
as
how
these
brave
belges
isn
t
the
ordinary
run
of
foreigners
,
and
certainly
he
s
a
most
polite
spoken
gentleman
.
dear
old
dorcas
!
as
she
stood
there
,
with
her
honest
face
upturned
to
mine
,
i
thought
what
a
fine
specimen
she
was
of
the
old
fashioned
servant
that
is
so
fast
dying
out
.
i
thought
i
might
as
well
go
down
to
the
village
at
once
,
and
look
up
poirot
but
i
met
him
half
way
,
coming
up
to
the
house
,
and
at
once
gave
him
dorcas
s
message
.
ah
,
the
brave
dorcas
!
we
will
look
at
the
chest
,
although
but
no
matter
we
will
examine
it
all
the
same
.
we
entered
the
house
by
one
of
the
windows
.
there
was
no
one
in
the
hall
,
and
we
went
straight
up
to
the
attic
.
sure
enough
,
there
was
the
chest
,
a
fine
old
piece
,
all
studded
with
brass
nails
,
and
full
to
overflowing
with
every
imaginable
type
of
garment
.
poirot
bundled
everything
out
on
the
floor
with
scant
ceremony
.
there
were
one
or
two
green
fabrics
of
varying
shades
but
poirot
shook
his
head
over
them
all
.
he
seemed
somewhat
apathetic
in
the
search
,
as
though
he
expected
no
great
results
from
it
.
suddenly
he
gave
an
exclamation
.
what
is
it
?
look
!
the
chest
was
nearly
empty
,
and
there
,
reposing
right
at
the
bottom
,
was
a
magnificent
black
beard
.
oh
!
said
poirot
.
oh
!
he
turned
it
over
in
his
hands
,
examining
it
closely
.
new
,
he
remarked
.
yes
,
quite
new
.
after
a
moment
s
hesitation
,
he
replaced
it
in
the
chest
,
heaped
all
the
other
things
on
top
of
it
as
before
,
and
made
his
way
briskly
downstairs
.
he
went
straight
to
the
pantry
,
where
we
found
dorcas
busily
polishing
her
silver
.
poirot
wished
her
good
morning
with
gallic
politeness
,
and
went
on
we
have
been
looking
through
that
chest
,
dorcas
.
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
mentioning
it
.
there
is
,
indeed
,
a
fine
collection
there
.
are
they
often
used
,
may
i
ask
?
well
,
sir
,
not
very
often
nowadays
,
though
from
time
to
time
we
do
have
what
the
young
gentlemen
call
a
dress
up
night
.
and
very
funny
it
is
sometimes
,
sir
.
mr
.
lawrence
,
he
s
wonderful
.
most
comic
!
i
shall
never
forget
the
night
he
came
down
as
the
char
of
persia
,
i
think
he
called
it
a
sort
of
eastern
king
it
was
.
he
had
the
big
paper
knife
in
his
hand
,
and
mind
,
dorcas
,
he
says
,
you
ll
have
to
be
very
respectful
.
this
is
my
specially
sharpened
scimitar
,
and
it
s
off
with
your
head
if
i
m
at
all
displeased
with
you
!
miss
cynthia
,
she
was
what
they
call
an
apache
,
or
some
such
name
a
frenchified
sort
of
cut
throat
,
i
take
it
to
be
.
a
real
sight
she
looked
.
you
d
never
have
believed
a
pretty
young
lady
like
that
could
have
made
herself
into
such
a
ruffian
.
nobody
would
have
known
her
.
these
evenings
must
have
been
great
fun
,
said
poirot
genially
.
i
suppose
mr
.
lawrence
wore
that
fine
black
beard
in
the
chest
upstairs
,
when
he
was
shah
of
persia
?
he
did
have
a
beard
,
sir
,
replied
dorcas
,
smiling
.
and
well
i
know
it
,
for
he
borrowed
two
skeins
of
my
black
wool
to
make
it
with
!
and
i
m
sure
it
looked
wonderfully
natural
at
a
distance
.
i
didn
t
know
as
there
was
a
beard
up
there
at
all
.
it
must
have
been
got
quite
lately
,
i
think
.
there
was
a
red
wig
,
i
know
,
but
nothing
else
in
the
way
of
hair
.
burnt
corks
they
use
mostly
though
tis
messy
getting
it
off
again
.
miss
cynthia
was
a
nigger
once
,
and
,
oh
,
the
trouble
she
had
.
so
dorcas
knows
nothing
about
that
black
beard
,
said
poirot
thoughtfully
,
as
we
walked
out
into
the
hall
again
.
do
you
think
it
is
the
one
?
i
whispered
eagerly
.
poirot
nodded
.
i
do
.
you
notice
it
had
been
trimmed
?
no
.
yes
.
it
was
cut
exactly
the
shape
of
mr
.
inglethorp
s
,
and
i
found
one
or
two
snipped
hairs
.
hastings
,
this
affair
is
very
deep
.
who
put
it
in
the
chest
,
i
wonder
?
someone
with
a
good
deal
of
intelligence
,
remarked
poirot
dryly
.
you
realize
that
he
chose
the
one
place
in
the
house
to
hide
it
where
its
presence
would
not
be
remarked
?
yes
,
he
is
intelligent
.
but
we
must
be
more
intelligent
.
we
must
be
so
intelligent
that
he
does
not
suspect
us
of
being
intelligent
at
all
.
i
acquiesced
.
there
,
mon
ami
,
you
will
be
of
great
assistance
to
me
.
i
was
pleased
with
the
compliment
.
there
had
been
times
when
i
hardly
thought
that
poirot
appreciated
me
at
my
true
worth
.
yes
,
he
continued
,
staring
at
me
thoughtfully
,
you
will
be
invaluable
.
this
was
naturally
gratifying
,
but
poirot
s
next
words
were
not
so
welcome
.
i
must
have
an
ally
in
the
house
,
he
observed
reflectively
.
you
have
me
,
i
protested
.
true
,
but
you
are
not
sufficient
.
i
was
hurt
,
and
showed
it
.
poirot
hurried
to
explain
himself
.
you
do
not
quite
take
my
meaning
.
you
are
known
to
be
working
with
me
.
i
want
somebody
who
is
not
associated
with
us
in
any
way
.
oh
,
i
see
.
how
about
john
?
no
,
i
think
not
.
the
dear
fellow
isn
t
perhaps
very
bright
,
i
said
thoughtfully
.
here
comes
miss
howard
,
said
poirot
suddenly
.
she
is
the
very
person
.
but
i
am
in
her
black
books
,
since
i
cleared
mr
.
inglethorp
.
still
,
we
can
but
try
.
with
a
nod
that
was
barely
civil
,
miss
howard
assented
to
poirot
s
request
for
a
few
minutes
conversation
.
we
went
into
the
little
morning
room
,
and
poirot
closed
the
door
.
well
,
monsieur
poirot
,
said
miss
howard
impatiently
,
what
is
it
?
out
with
it
.
i
m
busy
.
do
you
remember
,
mademoiselle
,
that
i
once
asked
you
to
help
me
?
yes
,
i
do
.
the
lady
nodded
.
and
i
told
you
i
d
help
you
with
pleasure
to
hang
alfred
inglethorp
.
ah
!
poirot
studied
her
seriously
.
miss
howard
,
i
will
ask
you
one
question
.
i
beg
of
you
to
reply
to
it
truthfully
.
never
tell
lies
,
replied
miss
howard
.
it
is
this
.
do
you
still
believe
that
mrs
.
inglethorp
was
poisoned
by
her
husband
?
what
do
you
mean
?
she
asked
sharply
.
you
needn
t
think
your
pretty
explanations
influence
me
in
the
slightest
.
i
ll
admit
that
it
wasn
t
he
who
bought
strychnine
at
the
chemist
s
shop
.
what
of
that
?
i
dare
say
he
soaked
fly
paper
,
as
i
told
you
at
the
beginning
.
that
is
arsenic
not
strychnine
,
said
poirot
mildly
.
what
does
that
matter
?
arsenic
would
put
poor
emily
out
of
the
way
just
as
well
as
strychnine
.
if
i
m
convinced
he
did
it
,
it
doesn
t
matter
a
jot
to
me
how
he
did
it
.
exactly
.
if
you
are
convinced
he
did
it
,
said
poirot
quietly
.
i
will
put
my
question
in
another
form
.
did
you
ever
in
your
heart
of
hearts
believe
that
mrs
.
inglethorp
was
poisoned
by
her
husband
?
good
heavens
!
cried
miss
howard
.
haven
t
i
always
told
you
the
man
is
a
villain
?
haven
t
i
always
told
you
he
would
murder
her
in
her
bed
?
haven
t
i
always
hated
him
like
poison
?
exactly
,
said
poirot
.
that
bears
out
my
little
idea
entirely
.
what
little
idea
?
miss
howard
,
do
you
remember
a
conversation
that
took
place
on
the
day
of
my
friend
s
arrival
here
?
he
repeated
it
to
me
,
and
there
is
a
sentence
of
yours
that
has
impressed
me
very
much
.
do
you
remember
affirming
that
if
a
crime
had
been
committed
,
and
anyone
you
loved
had
been
murdered
,
you
felt
certain
that
you
would
know
by
instinct
who
the
criminal
was
,
even
if
you
were
quite
unable
to
prove
it
?
yes
,
i
remember
saying
that
.
i
believe
it
too
.
i
suppose
you
think
it
nonsense
?
not
at
all
.
and
yet
you
will
pay
no
attention
to
my
instinct
against
alfred
inglethorp
.
no
,
said
poirot
curtly
.
because
your
instinct
is
not
against
mr
.
inglethorp
.
what
?
no
.
you
wish
to
believe
he
committed
the
crime
.
you
believe
him
capable
of
committing
it
.
but
your
instinct
tells
you
he
did
not
commit
it
.
it
tells
you
more
shall
i
go
on
?
she
was
staring
at
him
,
fascinated
,
and
made
a
slight
affirmative
movement
of
the
hand
.
shall
i
tell
you
why
you
have
been
so
vehement
against
mr
.
inglethorp
?
it
is
because
you
have
been
trying
to
believe
what
you
wish
to
believe
.
it
is
because
you
are
trying
to
drown
and
stifle
your
instinct
,
which
tells
you
another
name
no
,
no
,
no
!
cried
miss
howard
wildly
,
flinging
up
her
hands
.
don
t
say
it
!
oh
,
don
t
say
it
!
it
isn
t
true
!
it
can
t
be
true
.
i
don
t
know
what
put
such
a
wild
such
a
dreadful
idea
into
my
head
!
i
am
right
,
am
i
not
?
asked
poirot
.
yes
,
yes
you
must
be
a
wizard
to
have
guessed
.
but
it
can
t
be
so
it
s
too
monstrous
,
too
impossible
.
it
must
be
alfred
inglethorp
.
poirot
shook
his
head
gravely
.
don
t
ask
me
about
it
,
continued
miss
howard
,
because
i
shan
t
tell
you
.
i
won
t
admit
it
,
even
to
myself
.
i
must
be
mad
to
think
of
such
a
thing
.
poirot
nodded
,
as
if
satisfied
.
i
will
ask
you
nothing
.
it
is
enough
for
me
that
it
is
as
i
thought
.
and
i
i
,
too
,
have
an
instinct
.
we
are
working
together
towards
a
common
end
.
don
t
ask
me
to
help
you
,
because
i
won
t
.
i
wouldn
t
lift
a
finger
to
to
she
faltered
.
you
will
help
me
in
spite
of
yourself
.
i
ask
you
nothing
but
you
will
be
my
ally
.
you
will
not
be
able
to
help
yourself
.
you
will
do
the
only
thing
that
i
want
of
you
.
and
that
is
?
you
will
watch
!
evelyn
howard
bowed
her
head
.
yes
,
i
can
t
help
doing
that
.
i
am
always
watching
always
hoping
i
shall
be
proved
wrong
.
if
we
are
wrong
,
well
and
good
,
said
poirot
.
no
one
will
be
more
pleased
than
i
shall
.
but
,
if
we
are
right
?
if
we
are
right
,
miss
howard
,
on
whose
side
are
you
then
?
i
don
t
know
,
i
don
t
know
come
now
.
it
could
be
hushed
up
.
there
must
be
no
hushing
up
.
but
emily
herself
she
broke
off
.
miss
howard
,
said
poirot
gravely
,
this
is
unworthy
of
you
.
suddenly
she
took
her
face
from
her
hands
.
yes
,
she
said
quietly
,
that
was
not
evelyn
howard
who
spoke
!
she
flung
her
head
up
proudly
.
this
is
evelyn
howard
!
and
she
is
on
the
side
of
justice
!
let
the
cost
be
what
it
may
.
and
with
these
words
,
she
walked
firmly
out
of
the
room
.
there
,
said
poirot
,
looking
after
her
,
goes
a
very
valuable
ally
.
that
woman
,
hastings
,
has
got
brains
as
well
as
a
heart
.
i
did
not
reply
.
instinct
is
a
marvellous
thing
,
mused
poirot
.
it
can
neither
be
explained
nor
ignored
.
you
and
miss
howard
seem
to
know
what
you
are
talking
about
,
i
observed
coldly
.
perhaps
you
don
t
realize
that
i
am
still
in
the
dark
.
really
?
is
that
so
,
mon
ami
?
yes
.
enlighten
me
,
will
you
?
poirot
studied
me
attentively
for
a
moment
or
two
.
then
,
to
my
intense
surprise
,
he
shook
his
head
decidedly
.
no
,
my
friend
.
oh
,
look
here
,
why
not
?
two
is
enough
for
a
secret
.
well
,
i
think
it
is
very
unfair
to
keep
back
facts
from
me
.
i
am
not
keeping
back
facts
.
every
fact
that
i
know
is
in
your
possession
.
you
can
draw
your
own
deductions
from
them
.
this
time
it
is
a
question
of
ideas
.
still
,
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
.
poirot
looked
at
me
very
earnestly
,
and
again
shook
his
head
.
you
see
,
he
said
sadly
,
you
have
no
instincts
.
it
was
intelligence
you
were
requiring
just
now
,
i
pointed
out
.
the
two
often
go
together
,
said
poirot
enigmatically
.
the
remark
seemed
so
utterly
irrelevant
that
i
did
not
even
take
the
trouble
to
answer
it
.
but
i
decided
that
if
i
made
any
interesting
and
important
discoveries
as
no
doubt
i
should
i
would
keep
them
to
myself
,
and
surprise
poirot
with
the
ultimate
result
.
there
are
times
when
it
is
one
s
duty
to
assert
oneself
.
chapter
ix
.
dr
.
bauerstein
i
had
had
no
opportunity
as
yet
of
passing
on
poirot
s
message
to
lawrence
.
but
now
,
as
i
strolled
out
on
the
lawn
,
still
nursing
a
grudge
against
my
friend
s
high
handedness
,
i
saw
lawrence
on
the
croquet
lawn
,
aimlessly
knocking
a
couple
of
very
ancient
balls
about
,
with
a
still
more
ancient
mallet
.
it
struck
me
that
it
would
be
a
good
opportunity
to
deliver
my
message
.
otherwise
,
poirot
himself
might
relieve
me
of
it
.
it
was
true
that
i
did
not
quite
gather
its
purport
,
but
i
flattered
myself
that
by
lawrence
s
reply
,
and
perhaps
a
little
skillful
cross
examination
on
my
part
,
i
should
soon
perceive
its
significance
.
accordingly
i
accosted
him
.
i
ve
been
looking
for
you
,
i
remarked
untruthfully
.
have
you
?
yes
.
the
truth
is
,
i
ve
got
a
message
for
you
from
poirot
.
yes
?
he
told
me
to
wait
until
i
was
alone
with
you
,
i
said
,
dropping
my
voice
significantly
,
and
watching
him
intently
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
.
i
have
always
been
rather
good
at
what
is
called
,
i
believe
,
creating
an
atmosphere
.
well
?
there
was
no
change
of
expression
in
the
dark
melancholic
face
.
had
he
any
idea
of
what
i
was
about
to
say
?
this
is
the
message
.
i
dropped
my
voice
still
lower
.
find
the
extra
coffee
cup
,
and
you
can
rest
in
peace
.
what
on
earth
does
he
mean
?
lawrence
stared
at
me
in
quite
unaffected
astonishment
.
don
t
you
know
?
not
in
the
least
.
do
you
?
i
was
compelled
to
shake
my
head
.
what
extra
coffee
cup
?
i
don
t
know
.
he
d
better
ask
dorcas
,
or
one
of
the
maids
,
if
he
wants
to
know
about
coffee
cups
.
it
s
their
business
,
not
mine
.
i
don
t
know
anything
about
the
coffee
cups
,
except
that
we
ve
got
some
that
are
never
used
,
which
are
a
perfect
dream
!
old
worcester
.
you
re
not
a
connoisseur
,
are
you
,
hastings
?
i
shook
my
head
.
you
miss
a
lot
.
a
really
perfect
bit
of
old
china
it
s
pure
delight
to
handle
it
,
or
even
to
look
at
it
.
well
,
what
am
i
to
tell
poirot
?
tell
him
i
don
t
know
what
he
s
talking
about
.
it
s
double
dutch
to
me
.
all
right
.
i
was
moving
off
towards
the
house
again
when
he
suddenly
called
me
back
.
i
say
,
what
was
the
end
of
that
message
?
say
it
over
again
,
will
you
?
find
the
extra
coffee
cup
,
and
you
can
rest
in
peace
.
are
you
sure
you
don
t
know
what
it
means
?
i
asked
him
earnestly
.
he
shook
his
head
.
no
,
he
said
musingly
,
i
don
t
.
i
i
wish
i
did
.
the
boom
of
the
gong
sounded
from
the
house
,
and
we
went
in
together
.
poirot
had
been
asked
by
john
to
remain
to
lunch
,
and
was
already
seated
at
the
table
.
by
tacit
consent
,
all
mention
of
the
tragedy
was
barred
.
we
conversed
on
the
war
,
and
other
outside
topics
.
but
after
the
cheese
and
biscuits
had
been
handed
round
,
and
dorcas
had
left
the
room
,
poirot
suddenly
leant
forward
to
mrs
.
cavendish
.
pardon
me
,
madame
,
for
recalling
unpleasant
memories
,
but
i
have
a
little
idea
poirot
s
little
ideas
were
becoming
a
perfect
byword
and
would
like
to
ask
one
or
two
questions
.
of
me
?
certainly
.
you
are
too
amiable
,
madame
.
what
i
want
to
ask
is
this
the
door
leading
into
mrs
.
inglethorp
s
room
from
that
of
mademoiselle
cynthia
,
it
was
bolted
,
you
say
?
certainly
it
was
bolted
,
replied
mary
cavendish
,
rather
surprised
.
i
said
so
at
the
inquest
.
bolted
?
yes
.
she
looked
perplexed
.
i
mean
,
explained
poirot
,
you
are
sure
it
was
bolted
,
and
not
merely
locked
?
oh
,
i
see
what
you
mean
.
no
,
i
don
t
know
.
i
said
bolted
,
meaning
that
it
was
fastened
,
and
i
could
not
open
it
,
but
i
believe
all
the
doors
were
found
bolted
on
the
inside
.
still
,
as
far
as
you
are
concerned
,
the
door
might
equally
well
have
been
locked
?
oh
,
yes
.
you
yourself
did
not
happen
to
notice
,
madame
,
when
you
entered
mrs
.
inglethorp
s
room
,
whether
that
door
was
bolted
or
not
?
i
i
believe
it
was
.
but
you
did
not
see
it
?
no
.
i
never
looked
.
but
i
did
,
interrupted
lawrence
suddenly
.
i
happened
to
notice
that
it
was
bolted
.
ah
,
that
settles
it
.
and
poirot
looked
crestfallen
.
i
could
not
help
rejoicing
that
,
for
once
,
one
of
his
little
ideas
had
come
to
naught
.
after
lunch
poirot
begged
me
to
accompany
him
home
.
i
consented
rather
stiffly
.
you
are
annoyed
,
is
it
not
so
?
he
asked
anxiously
,
as
we
walked
through
the
park
.
not
at
all
,
i
said
coldly
.
that
is
well
.
that
lifts
a
great
load
from
my
mind
.
this
was
not
quite
what
i
had
intended
.
i
had
hoped
that
he
would
have
observed
the
stiffness
of
my
manner
.
still
,
the
fervour
of
his
words
went
towards
the
appeasing
of
my
just
displeasure
.
i
thawed
.
i
gave
lawrence
your
message
,
i
said
.
and
what
did
he
say
?
he
was
entirely
puzzled
?
yes
.
i
am
quite
sure
he
had
no
idea
of
what
you
meant
.
i
had
expected
poirot
to
be
disappointed
but
,
to
my
surprise
,
he
replied
that
that
was
as
he
had
thought
,
and
that
he
was
very
glad
.
my
pride
forbade
me
to
ask
any
questions
.
poirot
switched
off
on
another
tack
.
mademoiselle
cynthia
was
not
at
lunch
to
day
?
how
was
that
?
she
is
at
the
hospital
again
.
she
resumed
work
to
day
.
ah
,
she
is
an
industrious
little
demoiselle
.
and
pretty
too
.
she
is
like
pictures
i
have
seen
in
italy
.
i
would
rather
like
to
see
that
dispensary
of
hers
.
do
you
think
she
would
show
it
to
me
?
i
am
sure
she
would
be
delighted
.
it
s
an
interesting
little
place
.
does
she
go
there
every
day
?
she
has
all
wednesdays
off
,
and
comes
back
to
lunch
on
saturdays
.
those
are
her
only
times
off
.
i
will
remember
.
women
are
doing
great
work
nowadays
,
and
mademoiselle
cynthia
is
clever
oh
,
yes
,
she
has
brains
,
that
little
one
.
yes
.
i
believe
she
has
passed
quite
a
stiff
exam
.
without
doubt
.
after
all
,
it
is
very
responsible
work
.
i
suppose
they
have
very
strong
poisons
there
?
yes
,
she
showed
them
to
us
.
they
are
kept
locked
up
in
a
little
cupboard
.
i
believe
they
have
to
be
very
careful
.
they
always
take
out
the
key
before
leaving
the
room
.
indeed
.
it
is
near
the
window
,
this
cupboard
?
no
,
right
the
other
side
of
the
room
.
why
?
poirot
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
i
wondered
.
that
is
all
.
will
you
come
in
?
we
had
reached
the
cottage
.
no
.
i
think
i
ll
be
getting
back
.
i
shall
go
round
the
long
way
through
the
woods
.
the
woods
round
styles
were
very
beautiful
.
after
the
walk
across
the
open
park
,
it
was
pleasant
to
saunter
lazily
through
the
cool
glades
.
there
was
hardly
a
breath
of
wind
,
the
very
chirp
of
the
birds
was
faint
and
subdued
.
i
strolled
on
a
little
way
,
and
finally
flung
myself
down
at
the
foot
of
a
grand
old
beech
tree
.
my
thoughts
of
mankind
were
kindly
and
charitable
.
i
even
forgave
poirot
for
his
absurd
secrecy
.
in
fact
,
i
was
at
peace
with
the
world
.
then
i
yawned
.
i
thought
about
the
crime
,
and
it
struck
me
as
being
very
unreal
and
far
off
.
i
yawned
again
.
probably
,
i
thought
,
it
really
never
happened
.
of
course
,
it
was
all
a
bad
dream
.
the
truth
of
the
matter
was
that
it
was
lawrence
who
had
murdered
alfred
inglethorp
with
a
croquet
mallet
.
but
it
was
absurd
of
john
to
make
such
a
fuss
about
it
,
and
to
go
shouting
out
i
tell
you
i
won
t
have
it
!
i
woke
up
with
a
start
.
at
once
i
realized
that
i
was
in
a
very
awkward
predicament
.
for
,
about
twelve
feet
away
from
me
,
john
and
mary
cavendish
were
standing
facing
each
other
,
and
they
were
evidently
quarrelling
.
and
,
quite
as
evidently
,
they
were
unaware
of
my
vicinity
,
for
before
i
could
move
or
speak
john
repeated
the
words
which
had
aroused
me
from
my
dream
.
i
tell
you
,
mary
,
i
won
t
have
it
.
mary
s
voice
came
,
cool
and
liquid
have
you
any
right
to
criticize
my
actions
?
it
will
be
the
talk
of
the
village
!
my
mother
was
only
buried
on
saturday
,
and
here
you
are
gadding
about
with
the
fellow
.
oh
,
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
,
if
it
is
only
village
gossip
that
you
mind
!
but
it
isn
t
.
i
ve
had
enough
of
the
fellow
hanging
about
.
he
s
a
polish
jew
,
anyway
.
a
tinge
of
jewish
blood
is
not
a
bad
thing
.
it
leavens
the
she
looked
at
him
stolid
stupidity
of
the
ordinary
englishman
.
fire
in
her
eyes
,
ice
in
her
voice
.
i
did
not
wonder
that
the
blood
rose
to
john
s
face
in
a
crimson
tide
.
mary
!
well
?
her
tone
did
not
change
.
the
pleading
died
out
of
his
voice
.
am
i
to
understand
that
you
will
continue
to
see
bauerstein
against
my
express
wishes
?
if
i
choose
.
you
defy
me
?
no
,
but
i
deny
your
right
to
criticize
my
actions
.
have
you
no
friends
of
whom
i
should
disapprove
?
john
fell
back
a
pace
.
the
colour
ebbed
slowly
from
his
face
.
what
do
you
mean
?
he
said
,
in
an
unsteady
voice
.
you
see
!
said
mary
quietly
.
you
do
see
,
don
t
you
,
that
you
have
no
right
to
dictate
to
me
as
to
the
choice
of
my
friends
?
john
glanced
at
her
pleadingly
,
a
stricken
look
on
his
face
.
no
right
?
have
i
no
right
,
mary
?
he
said
unsteadily
.
he
stretched
out
his
hands
.
mary
for
a
moment
,
i
thought
she
wavered
.
a
softer
expression
came
over
her
face
,
then
suddenly
she
turned
almost
fiercely
away
.
none
!
she
was
walking
away
when
john
sprang
after
her
,
and
caught
her
by
the
arm
.
mary
his
voice
was
very
quiet
now
are
you
in
love
with
this
fellow
bauerstein
?
she
hesitated
,
and
suddenly
there
swept
across
her
face
a
strange
expression
,
old
as
the
hills
,
yet
with
something
eternally
young
about
it
.
so
might
some
egyptian
sphinx
have
smiled
.
she
freed
herself
quietly
from
his
arm
,
and
spoke
over
her
shoulder
.
perhaps
,
she
said
and
then
swiftly
passed
out
of
the
little
glade
,
leaving
john
standing
there
as
though
he
had
been
turned
to
stone
.
rather
ostentatiously
,
i
stepped
forward
,
crackling
some
dead
branches
with
my
feet
as
i
did
so
.
john
turned
.
luckily
,
he
took
it
for
granted
that
i
had
only
just
come
upon
the
scene
.
hullo
,
hastings
.
have
you
seen
the
little
fellow
safely
back
to
his
cottage
?
quaint
little
chap
!
is
he
any
good
,
though
,
really
?
he
was
considered
one
of
the
finest
detectives
of
his
day
.
oh
,
well
,
i
suppose
there
must
be
something
in
it
,
then
.
what
a
rotten
world
it
is
,
though
!
you
find
it
so
?
i
asked
.
good
lord
,
yes
!
there
s
this
terrible
business
to
start
with
.
scotland
yard
men
in
and
out
of
the
house
like
a
jack
in
the
box
!
never
know
where
they
won
t
turn
up
next
.
screaming
headlines
in
every
paper
in
the
country
damn
all
journalists
,
i
say
!
do
you
know
there
was
a
whole
crowd
staring
in
at
the
lodge
gates
this
morning
.
sort
of
madame
tussaud
s
chamber
of
horrors
business
that
can
be
seen
for
nothing
.
pretty
thick
,
isn
t
it
?
cheer
up
,
john
!
i
said
soothingly
.
it
can
t
last
for
ever
.
can
t
it
,
though
?
it
can
last
long
enough
for
us
never
to
be
able
to
hold
up
our
heads
again
.
no
,
no
,
you
re
getting
morbid
on
the
subject
.
enough
to
make
a
man
morbid
,
to
be
stalked
by
beastly
journalists
and
stared
at
by
gaping
moon
faced
idiots
,
wherever
he
goes
!
but
there
s
worse
than
that
.
what
?
john
lowered
his
voice
have
you
ever
thought
,
hastings
it
s
a
nightmare
to
me
who
did
it
?
i
can
t
help
feeling
sometimes
it
must
have
been
an
accident
.
because
because
who
could
have
done
it
?
now
inglethorp
s
out
of
the
way
,
there
s
no
one
else
no
one
,
i
mean
,
except
one
of
us
.
yes
,
indeed
,
that
was
nightmare
enough
for
any
man
!
one
of
us
?
yes
,
surely
it
must
be
so
,
unless
a
new
idea
suggested
itself
to
my
mind
.
rapidly
,
i
considered
it
.
the
light
increased
.
poirot
s
mysterious
doings
,
his
hints
they
all
fitted
in
.
fool
that
i
was
not
to
have
thought
of
this
possibility
before
,
and
what
a
relief
for
us
all
.
no
,
john
,
i
said
,
it
isn
t
one
of
us
.
how
could
it
be
?
i
know
,
but
,
still
,
who
else
is
there
?
can
t
you
guess
?
no
.
i
looked
cautiously
round
,
and
lowered
my
voice
.
dr
.
bauerstein
!
i
whispered
.
impossible
!
not
at
all
.
but
what
earthly
interest
could
he
have
in
my
mother
s
death
?
that
i
don
t
see
,
i
confessed
,
but
i
ll
tell
you
this
poirot
thinks
so
.
poirot
?
does
he
?
how
do
you
know
?
i
told
him
of
poirot
s
intense
excitement
on
hearing
that
dr
.
bauerstein
had
been
at
styles
on
the
fatal
night
,
and
added
he
said
twice
that
alters
everything
.
and
i
ve
been
thinking
.
you
know
inglethorp
said
he
had
put
down
the
coffee
in
the
hall
?
well
,
it
was
just
then
that
bauerstein
arrived
.
isn
t
it
possible
that
,
as
inglethorp
brought
him
through
the
hall
,
the
doctor
dropped
something
into
the
coffee
in
passing
?
h
m
,
said
john
.
it
would
have
been
very
risky
.
yes
,
but
it
was
possible
.
and
then
,
how
could
he
know
it
was
her
coffee
?
no
,
old
fellow
,
i
don
t
think
that
will
wash
.
but
i
had
remembered
something
else
.
you
re
quite
right
.
that
wasn
t
how
it
was
done
.
listen
.
and
i
then
told
him
of
the
cocoa
sample
which
poirot
had
taken
to
be
analysed
.
john
interrupted
just
as
i
had
done
.
but
,
look
here
,
bauerstein
had
had
it
analysed
already
?
yes
,
yes
,
that
s
the
point
.
i
didn
t
see
it
either
until
now
.
don
t
you
understand
?
bauerstein
had
it
analysed
that
s
just
it
!
if
bauerstein
s
the
murderer
,
nothing
could
be
simpler
than
for
him
to
substitute
some
ordinary
cocoa
for
his
sample
,
and
send
that
to
be
tested
.
and
of
course
they
would
find
no
strychnine
!
but
no
one
would
dream
of
suspecting
bauerstein
,
or
think
of
taking
another
sample
except
poirot
,
i
added
,
with
belated
recognition
.
yes
,
but
what
about
the
bitter
taste
that
cocoa
won
t
disguise
?
well
,
we
ve
only
his
word
for
that
.
and
there
are
other
possibilities
.
he
s
admittedly
one
of
the
world
s
greatest
toxicologists
one
of
the
world
s
greatest
what
?
say
it
again
.
he
knows
more
about
poisons
than
almost
anybody
,
i
explained
.
well
,
my
idea
is
,
that
perhaps
he
s
found
some
way
of
making
strychnine
tasteless
.
or
it
may
not
have
been
strychnine
at
all
,
but
some
obscure
drug
no
one
has
ever
heard
of
,
which
produces
much
the
same
symptoms
.
h
m
,
yes
,
that
might
be
,
said
john
.
but
look
here
,
how
could
he
have
got
at
the
cocoa
?
that
wasn
t
downstairs
?
no
,
it
wasn
t
,
i
admitted
reluctantly
.
and
then
,
suddenly
,
a
dreadful
possibility
flashed
through
my
mind
.
i
hoped
and
prayed
it
would
not
occur
to
john
also
.
i
glanced
sideways
at
him
.
he
was
frowning
perplexedly
,
and
i
drew
a
deep
breath
of
relief
,
for
the
terrible
thought
that
had
flashed
across
my
mind
was
this
that
dr
.
bauerstein
might
have
had
an
accomplice
.
yet
surely
it
could
not
be
!
surely
no
woman
as
beautiful
as
mary
cavendish
could
be
a
murderess
.
yet
beautiful
women
had
been
known
to
poison
.
and
suddenly
i
remembered
that
first
conversation
at
tea
on
the
day
of
my
arrival
,
and
the
gleam
in
her
eyes
as
she
had
said
that
poison
was
a
woman
s
weapon
.
how
agitated
she
had
been
on
that
fatal
tuesday
evening
!
had
mrs
.
inglethorp
discovered
something
between
her
and
bauerstein
,
and
threatened
to
tell
her
husband
?
was
it
to
stop
that
denunciation
that
the
crime
had
been
committed
?
then
i
remembered
that
enigmatical
conversation
between
poirot
and
evelyn
howard
.
was
this
what
they
had
meant
?
was
this
the
monstrous
possibility
that
evelyn
had
tried
not
to
believe
?
yes
,
it
all
fitted
in
.
no
wonder
miss
howard
had
suggested
hushing
it
up
.
now
i
understood
that
unfinished
sentence
of
hers
emily
herself
and
in
my
heart
i
agreed
with
her
.
would
not
mrs
.
inglethorp
have
preferred
to
go
unavenged
rather
than
have
such
terrible
dishonour
fall
upon
the
name
of
cavendish
.
there
s
another
thing
,
said
john
suddenly
,
and
the
unexpected
sound
of
his
voice
made
me
start
guiltily
.
something
which
makes
me
doubt
if
what
you
say
can
be
true
.
what
s
that
?
i
asked
,
thankful
that
he
had
gone
away
from
the
subject
of
how
the
poison
could
have
been
introduced
into
the
cocoa
.
why
,
the
fact
that
bauerstein
demanded
a
post
mortem
.
he
needn
t
have
done
so
.
little
wilkins
would
have
been
quite
content
to
let
it
go
at
heart
disease
.
yes
,
i
said
doubtfully
.
but
we
don
t
know
.
perhaps
he
thought
it
safer
in
the
long
run
.
someone
might
have
talked
afterwards
.
then
the
home
office
might
have
ordered
exhumation
.
the
whole
thing
would
have
come
out
,
then
,
and
he
would
have
been
in
an
awkward
position
,
for
no
one
would
have
believed
that
a
man
of
his
reputation
could
have
been
deceived
into
calling
it
heart
disease
.
yes
,
that
s
possible
,
admitted
john
.
still
,
he
added
,
i
m
blest
if
i
can
see
what
his
motive
could
have
been
.
i
trembled
.
look
here
,
i
said
,
i
may
be
altogether
wrong
.
and
,
remember
,
all
this
is
in
confidence
.
oh
,
of
course
that
goes
without
saying
.
we
had
walked
,
as
we
talked
,
and
now
we
passed
through
the
little
gate
into
the
garden
.
voices
rose
near
at
hand
,
for
tea
was
spread
out
under
the
sycamore
tree
,
as
it
had
been
on
the
day
of
my
arrival
.
cynthia
was
back
from
the
hospital
,
and
i
placed
my
chair
beside
her
,
and
told
her
of
poirot
s
wish
to
visit
the
dispensary
.
of
course
!
i
d
love
him
to
see
it
.
he
d
better
come
to
tea
there
one
day
.
i
must
fix
it
up
with
him
.
he
s
such
a
dear
little
man
!
but
he
is
funny
.
he
made
me
take
the
brooch
out
of
my
tie
the
other
day
,
and
put
it
in
again
,
because
he
said
it
wasn
t
straight
.
i
laughed
.
it
s
quite
a
mania
with
him
.
yes
,
isn
t
it
?
we
were
silent
for
a
minute
or
two
,
and
then
,
glancing
in
the
direction
of
mary
cavendish
,
and
dropping
her
voice
,
cynthia
said
mr
.
hastings
.
yes
?
after
tea
,
i
want
to
talk
to
you
.
her
glance
at
mary
had
set
me
thinking
.
i
fancied
that
between
these
two
there
existed
very
little
sympathy
.
for
the
first
time
,
it
occurred
to
me
to
wonder
about
the
girl
s
future
.
mrs
.
inglethorp
had
made
no
provisions
of
any
kind
for
her
,
but
i
imagined
that
john
and
mary
would
probably
insist
on
her
making
her
home
with
them
at
any
rate
until
the
end
of
the
war
.
john
,
i
knew
,
was
very
fond
of
her
,
and
would
be
sorry
to
let
her
go
.
john
,
who
had
gone
into
the
house
,
now
reappeared
.
his
good
natured
face
wore
an
unaccustomed
frown
of
anger
.
confound
those
detectives
!
i
can
t
think
what
they
re
after
!
they
ve
been
in
every
room
in
the
house
turning
things
inside
out
,
and
upside
down
.
it
really
is
too
bad
!
i
suppose
they
took
advantage
of
our
all
being
out
.
i
shall
go
for
that
fellow
japp
,
when
i
next
see
him
!
lot
of
paul
prys
,
grunted
miss
howard
.
lawrence
opined
that
they
had
to
make
a
show
of
doing
something
.
mary
cavendish
said
nothing
.
after
tea
,
i
invited
cynthia
to
come
for
a
walk
,
and
we
sauntered
off
into
the
woods
together
.
well
?
i
inquired
,
as
soon
as
we
were
protected
from
prying
eyes
by
the
leafy
screen
.
with
a
sigh
,
cynthia
flung
herself
down
,
and
tossed
off
her
hat
.
the
sunlight
,
piercing
through
the
branches
,
turned
the
auburn
of
her
hair
to
quivering
gold
.
mr
.
hastings
you
are
always
so
kind
,
and
you
know
such
a
lot
.
it
struck
me
at
this
moment
that
cynthia
was
really
a
very
charming
girl
!
much
more
charming
than
mary
,
who
never
said
things
of
that
kind
.
well
?
i
asked
benignantly
,
as
she
hesitated
.
i
want
to
ask
your
advice
.
what
shall
i
do
?
do
?
yes
.
you
see
,
aunt
emily
always
told
me
i
should
be
provided
for
.
i
suppose
she
forgot
,
or
didn
t
think
she
was
likely
to
die
anyway
,
i
am
not
provided
for
!
and
i
don
t
know
what
to
do
.
do
you
think
i
ought
to
go
away
from
here
at
once
?
good
heavens
,
no
!
they
don
t
want
to
part
with
you
,
i
m
sure
.
cynthia
hesitated
a
moment
,
plucking
up
the
grass
with
her
tiny
hands
.
then
she
said
mrs
.
cavendish
does
.
she
hates
me
.
hates
you
?
i
cried
,
astonished
.
cynthia
nodded
.
yes
.
i
don
t
know
why
,
but
she
can
t
bear
me
and
he
can
t
,
either
.
there
i
know
you
re
wrong
,
i
said
warmly
.
on
the
contrary
,
john
is
very
fond
of
you
.
oh
,
yes
john
.
i
meant
lawrence
.
not
,
of
course
,
that
i
care
whether
lawrence
hates
me
or
not
.
still
,
it
s
rather
horrid
when
no
one
loves
you
,
isn
t
it
?
but
they
do
,
cynthia
dear
,
i
said
earnestly
.
i
m
sure
you
are
mistaken
.
look
,
there
is
john
and
miss
howard
cynthia
nodded
rather
gloomily
.
yes
,
john
likes
me
,
i
think
,
and
of
course
evie
,
for
all
her
gruff
ways
,
wouldn
t
be
unkind
to
a
fly
.
but
lawrence
never
speaks
to
me
if
he
can
help
it
,
and
mary
can
hardly
bring
herself
to
be
civil
to
me
.
she
wants
evie
to
stay
on
,
is
begging
her
to
,
but
she
doesn
t
want
me
,
and
and
i
don
t
know
what
to
do
.
suddenly
the
poor
child
burst
out
crying
.
i
don
t
know
what
possessed
me
.
her
beauty
,
perhaps
,
as
she
sat
there
,
with
the
sunlight
glinting
down
on
her
head
perhaps
the
sense
of
relief
at
encountering
someone
who
so
obviously
could
have
no
connection
with
the
tragedy
perhaps
honest
pity
for
her
youth
and
loneliness
.
anyway
,
i
leant
forward
,
and
taking
her
little
hand
,
i
said
awkwardly
marry
me
,
cynthia
.
unwittingly
,
i
had
hit
upon
a
sovereign
remedy
for
her
tears
.
she
sat
up
at
once
,
drew
her
hand
away
,
and
said
,
with
some
asperity
don
t
be
silly
!
i
was
a
little
annoyed
.
i
m
not
being
silly
.
i
am
asking
you
to
do
me
the
honour
of
becoming
my
wife
.
to
my
intense
surprise
,
cynthia
burst
out
laughing
,
and
called
me
a
funny
dear
.
it
s
perfectly
sweet
of
you
,
she
said
,
but
you
know
you
don
t
want
to
!
yes
,
i
do
.
i
ve
got
never
mind
what
you
ve
got
.
you
don
t
really
want
to
and
i
don
t
either
.
well
,
of
course
,
that
settles
it
,
i
said
stiffly
.
but
i
don
t
see
anything
to
laugh
at
.
there
s
nothing
funny
about
a
proposal
.
no
,
indeed
,
said
cynthia
.
somebody
might
accept
you
next
time
.
good
bye
,
you
ve
cheered
me
up
very
much
.
and
,
with
a
final
uncontrollable
burst
of
merriment
,
she
vanished
through
the
trees
.
thinking
over
the
interview
,
it
struck
me
as
being
profoundly
unsatisfactory
.
it
occurred
to
me
suddenly
that
i
would
go
down
to
the
village
,
and
look
up
bauerstein
.
somebody
ought
to
be
keeping
an
eye
on
the
fellow
.
at
the
same
time
,
it
would
be
wise
to
allay
any
suspicions
he
might
have
as
to
his
being
suspected
.
i
remembered
how
poirot
had
relied
on
my
diplomacy
.
accordingly
,
i
went
to
the
little
house
with
the
apartments
card
inserted
in
the
window
,
where
i
knew
he
lodged
,
and
tapped
on
the
door
.
an
old
woman
came
and
opened
it
.
good
afternoon
,
i
said
pleasantly
.
is
dr
.
bauerstein
in
?
she
stared
at
me
.
haven
t
you
heard
?
heard
what
?
about
him
.
what
about
him
?
he
s
took
.
took
?
dead
?
no
,
took
by
the
perlice
.
by
the
police
!
i
gasped
.
do
you
mean
they
ve
arrested
him
?
yes
,
that
s
it
,
and
i
waited
to
hear
no
more
,
but
tore
up
the
village
to
find
poirot
.
chapter
x
.
the
arrest
to
my
extreme
annoyance
,
poirot
was
not
in
,
and
the
old
belgian
who
answered
my
knock
informed
me
that
he
believed
he
had
gone
to
london
.
i
was
dumbfounded
.
what
on
earth
could
poirot
be
doing
in
london
!
was
it
a
sudden
decision
on
his
part
,
or
had
he
already
made
up
his
mind
when
he
parted
from
me
a
few
hours
earlier
?
i
retraced
my
steps
to
styles
in
some
annoyance
.
with
poirot
away
,
i
was
uncertain
how
to
act
.
had
he
foreseen
this
arrest
?
had
he
not
,
in
all
probability
,
been
the
cause
of
it
?
those
questions
i
could
not
resolve
.
but
in
the
meantime
what
was
i
to
do
?
should
i
announce
the
arrest
openly
at
styles
,
or
not
?
though
i
did
not
acknowledge
it
to
myself
,
the
thought
of
mary
cavendish
was
weighing
on
me
.
would
it
not
be
a
terrible
shock
to
her
?
for
the
moment
,
i
set
aside
utterly
any
suspicions
of
her
.
she
could
not
be
implicated
otherwise
i
should
have
heard
some
hint
of
it
.
of
course
,
there
was
no
possibility
of
being
able
permanently
to
conceal
dr
.
bauerstein
s
arrest
from
her
.
it
would
be
announced
in
every
newspaper
on
the
morrow
.
still
,
i
shrank
from
blurting
it
out
.
if
only
poirot
had
been
accessible
,
i
could
have
asked
his
advice
.
what
possessed
him
to
go
posting
off
to
london
in
this
unaccountable
way
?
in
spite
of
myself
,
my
opinion
of
his
sagacity
was
immeasurably
heightened
.
i
would
never
have
dreamt
of
suspecting
the
doctor
,
had
not
poirot
put
it
into
my
head
.
yes
,
decidedly
,
the
little
man
was
clever
.
after
some
reflecting
,
i
decided
to
take
john
into
my
confidence
,
and
leave
him
to
make
the
matter
public
or
not
,
as
he
thought
fit
.
he
gave
vent
to
a
prodigious
whistle
,
as
i
imparted
the
news
.
great
scott
!
you
were
right
,
then
.
i
couldn
t
believe
it
at
the
time
.
no
,
it
is
astonishing
until
you
get
used
to
the
idea
,
and
see
how
it
makes
everything
fit
in
.
now
,
what
are
we
to
do
?
of
course
,
it
will
be
generally
known
to
morrow
.
john
reflected
.
never
mind
,
he
said
at
last
,
we
won
t
say
anything
at
present
.
there
is
no
need
.
as
you
say
,
it
will
be
known
soon
enough
.
but
to
my
intense
surprise
,
on
getting
down
early
the
next
morning
,
and
eagerly
opening
the
newspapers
,
there
was
not
a
word
about
the
arrest
!
there
was
a
column
of
mere
padding
about
the
styles
poisoning
case
,
but
nothing
further
.
it
was
rather
inexplicable
,
but
i
supposed
that
,
for
some
reason
or
other
,
japp
wished
to
keep
it
out
of
the
papers
.
it
worried
me
just
a
little
,
for
it
suggested
the
possibility
that
there
might
be
further
arrests
to
come
.
after
breakfast
,
i
decided
to
go
down
to
the
village
,
and
see
if
poirot
had
returned
yet
but
,
before
i
could
start
,
a
well
known
face
blocked
one
of
the
windows
,
and
the
well
known
voice
said
bonjour
,
mon
ami
!
poirot
,
i
exclaimed
,
with
relief
,
and
seizing
him
by
both
hands
,
i
dragged
him
into
the
room
.
i
was
never
so
glad
to
see
anyone
.
listen
,
i
have
said
nothing
to
anybody
but
john
.
is
that
right
?
my
friend
,
replied
poirot
,
i
do
not
know
what
you
are
talking
about
.
dr
.
bauerstein
s
arrest
,
of
course
,
i
answered
impatiently
.
is
bauerstein
arrested
,
then
?
did
you
not
know
it
?
not
the
least
in
the
world
.
but
,
pausing
a
moment
,
he
added
still
,
it
does
not
surprise
me
.
after
all
,
we
are
only
four
miles
from
the
coast
.
the
coast
?
i
asked
,
puzzled
.
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
it
?
poirot
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
surely
,
it
is
obvious
!
not
to
me
.
no
doubt
i
am
very
dense
,
but
i
cannot
see
what
the
proximity
of
the
coast
has
got
to
do
with
the
murder
of
mrs
.
inglethorp
.
nothing
at
all
,
of
course
,
replied
poirot
,
smiling
.
but
we
were
speaking
of
the
arrest
of
dr
.
bauerstein
.
well
,
he
is
arrested
for
the
murder
of
mrs
.
inglethorp
what
?
cried
poirot
,
in
apparently
lively
astonishment
.
dr
.
bauerstein
arrested
for
the
murder
of
mrs
.
inglethorp
?
yes
.
impossible
!
that
would
be
too
good
a
farce
!
who
told
you
that
,
my
friend
?
well
,
no
one
exactly
told
me
,
i
confessed
.
but
he
is
arrested
.
oh
,
yes
,
very
likely
.
but
for
espionage
,
mon
ami
.
espionage
?
i
gasped
.
precisely
.
not
for
poisoning
mrs
.
inglethorp
?
not
unless
our
friend
japp
has
taken
leave
of
his
senses
,
replied
poirot
placidly
.
but
but
i
thought
you
thought
so
too
?
poirot
gave
me
one
look
,
which
conveyed
a
wondering
pity
,
and
his
full
sense
of
the
utter
absurdity
of
such
an
idea
.
do
you
mean
to
say
,
i
asked
,
slowly
adapting
myself
to
the
new
idea
,
that
dr
.
bauerstein
is
a
spy
?
poirot
nodded
.
have
you
never
suspected
it
?
it
never
entered
my
head
.
it
did
not
strike
you
as
peculiar
that
a
famous
london
doctor
should
bury
himself
in
a
little
village
like
this
,
and
should
be
in
the
habit
of
walking
about
at
all
hours
of
the
night
,
fully
dressed
?
no
,
i
confessed
,
i
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
.
he
is
,
of
course
,
a
german
by
birth
,
said
poirot
thoughtfully
,
though
he
has
practised
so
long
in
this
country
that
nobody
thinks
of
him
as
anything
but
an
englishman
.
he
was
naturalized
about
fifteen
years
ago
.
a
very
clever
man
a
jew
,
of
course
.
the
blackguard
!
i
cried
indignantly
.
not
at
all
.
he
is
,
on
the
contrary
,
a
patriot
.
think
what
he
stands
to
lose
.
i
admire
the
man
myself
.
but
i
could
not
look
at
it
in
poirot
s
philosophical
way
.
and
this
is
the
man
with
whom
mrs
.
cavendish
has
been
wandering
about
all
over
the
country
!
i
cried
indignantly
.
yes
.
i
should
fancy
he
had
found
her
very
useful
,
remarked
poirot
.
so
long
as
gossip
busied
itself
in
coupling
their
names
together
,
any
other
vagaries
of
the
doctor
s
passed
unobserved
.
then
you
think
he
never
really
cared
for
her
?
i
asked
eagerly
rather
too
eagerly
,
perhaps
,
under
the
circumstances
.
that
,
of
course
,
i
cannot
say
,
but
shall
i
tell
you
my
own
private
opinion
,
hastings
?
yes
.
well
,
it
is
this
that
mrs
.
cavendish
does
not
care
,
and
never
has
cared
one
little
jot
about
dr
.
bauerstein
!
do
you
really
think
so
?
i
could
not
disguise
my
pleasure
.
i
am
quite
sure
of
it
.
and
i
will
tell
you
why
.
yes
?
because
she
cares
for
someone
else
,
mon
ami
.
oh
!
what
did
he
mean
?
in
spite
of
myself
,
an
agreeable
warmth
spread
over
me
.
i
am
not
a
vain
man
where
women
are
concerned
,
but
i
remembered
certain
evidences
,
too
lightly
thought
of
at
the
time
,
perhaps
,
but
which
certainly
seemed
to
indicate
my
pleasing
thoughts
were
interrupted
by
the
sudden
entrance
of
miss
howard
.
she
glanced
round
hastily
to
make
sure
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
room
,
and
quickly
produced
an
old
sheet
of
brown
paper
.
this
she
handed
to
poirot
,
murmuring
as
she
did
so
the
cryptic
words
on
top
of
the
wardrobe
.
then
she
hurriedly
left
the
room
.
poirot
unfolded
the
sheet
of
paper
eagerly
,
and
uttered
an
exclamation
of
satisfaction
.
he
spread
it
out
on
the
table
.
come
here
,
hastings
.
now
tell
me
,
what
is
that
initial
j
.
or
l
.?
it
was
a
medium
sized
sheet
of
paper
,
rather
dusty
,
as
though
it
had
lain
by
for
some
time
.
but
it
was
the
label
that
was
attracting
poirot
s
attention
.
at
the
top
,
it
bore
the
printed
stamp
of
messrs
.
parkson
s
,
the
well
known
theatrical
costumiers
,
and
it
was
addressed
to
the
debatable
initial
cavendish
,
esq
.,
styles
court
,
styles
st
.
mary
,
essex
.
it
might
be
t
.,
or
it
might
be
l
.,
i
said
,
after
studying
the
thing
for
a
minute
or
two
.
it
certainly
isn
t
a
j
.
good
,
replied
poirot
,
folding
up
the
paper
again
.
i
,
also
,
am
of
your
way
of
thinking
.
it
is
an
l
.,
depend
upon
it
!
where
did
it
come
from
?
i
asked
curiously
.
is
it
important
?
moderately
so
.
it
confirms
a
surmise
of
mine
.
having
deduced
its
existence
,
i
set
miss
howard
to
search
for
it
,
and
,
as
you
see
,
she
has
been
successful
.
what
did
she
mean
by
on
the
top
of
the
wardrobe
?
she
meant
,
replied
poirot
promptly
,
that
she
found
it
on
top
of
a
wardrobe
.
a
funny
place
for
a
piece
of
brown
paper
,
i
mused
.
not
at
all
.
the
top
of
a
wardrobe
is
an
excellent
place
for
brown
paper
and
cardboard
boxes
.
i
have
kept
them
there
myself
.
neatly
arranged
,
there
is
nothing
to
offend
the
eye
.
poirot
,
i
asked
earnestly
,
have
you
made
up
your
mind
about
this
crime
?
yes
that
is
to
say
,
i
believe
i
know
how
it
was
committed
.
ah
!
unfortunately
,
i
have
no
proof
beyond
my
surmise
,
unless
with
sudden
energy
,
he
caught
me
by
the
arm
,
and
whirled
me
down
the
hall
,
calling
out
in
french
in
his
excitement
mademoiselle
dorcas
,
mademoiselle
dorcas
,
un
moment
,
s
il
vous
pla
t
!
dorcas
,
quite
flurried
by
the
noise
,
came
hurrying
out
of
the
pantry
.
my
good
dorcas
,
i
have
an
idea
a
little
idea
if
it
should
prove
justified
,
what
magnificent
chance
!
tell
me
,
on
monday
,
not
tuesday
,
dorcas
,
but
monday
,
the
day
before
the
tragedy
,
did
anything
go
wrong
with
mrs
.
inglethorp
s
bell
?
dorcas
looked
very
surprised
.
yes
,
sir
,
now
you
mention
it
,
it
did
though
i
don
t
know
how
you
came
to
hear
of
it
.
a
mouse
,
or
some
such
,
must
have
nibbled
the
wire
through
.
the
man
came
and
put
it
right
on
tuesday
morning
.
with
a
long
drawn
exclamation
of
ecstasy
,
poirot
led
the
way
back
to
the
morning
room
.
see
you
,
one
should
not
ask
for
outside
proof
no
,
reason
should
be
enough
.
but
the
flesh
is
weak
,
it
is
consolation
to
find
that
one
is
on
the
right
track
.
ah
,
my
friend
,
i
am
like
a
giant
refreshed
.
i
run
!
i
leap
!
and
,
in
very
truth
,
run
and
leap
he
did
,
gambolling
wildly
down
the
stretch
of
lawn
outside
the
long
window
.
what
is
your
remarkable
little
friend
doing
?
asked
a
voice
behind
me
,
and
i
turned
to
find
mary
cavendish
at
my
elbow
.
she
smiled
,
and
so
did
i
.
what
is
it
all
about
?
really
,
i
can
t
tell
you
.
he
asked
dorcas
some
question
about
a
bell
,
and
appeared
so
delighted
with
her
answer
that
he
is
capering
about
as
you
see
!
mary
laughed
.
how
ridiculous
!
he
s
going
out
of
the
gate
.
isn
t
he
coming
back
to
day
?
i
don
t
know
.
i
ve
given
up
trying
to
guess
what
he
ll
do
next
.
is
he
quite
mad
,
mr
.
hastings
?
i
honestly
don
t
know
.
sometimes
,
i
feel
sure
he
is
as
mad
as
a
hatter
and
then
,
just
as
he
is
at
his
maddest
,
i
find
there
is
method
in
his
madness
.
i
see
.
in
spite
of
her
laugh
,
mary
was
looking
thoughtful
this
morning
.
she
seemed
grave
,
almost
sad
.
it
occurred
to
me
that
it
would
be
a
good
opportunity
to
tackle
her
on
the
subject
of
cynthia
.
i
began
rather
tactfully
,
i
thought
,
but
i
had
not
gone
far
before
she
stopped
me
authoritatively
.
you
are
an
excellent
advocate
,
i
have
no
doubt
,
mr
.
hastings
,
but
in
this
case
your
talents
are
quite
thrown
away
.
cynthia
will
run
no
risk
of
encountering
any
unkindness
from
me
.
i
began
to
stammer
feebly
that
i
hoped
she
hadn
t
thought
but
again
she
stopped
me
,
and
her
words
were
so
unexpected
that
they
quite
drove
cynthia
,
and
her
troubles
,
out
of
my
mind
.
mr
.
hastings
,
she
said
,
do
you
think
i
and
my
husband
are
happy
together
?
i
was
considerably
taken
aback
,
and
murmured
something
about
it
s
not
being
my
business
to
think
anything
of
the
sort
.
well
,
she
said
quietly
,
whether
it
is
your
business
or
not
,
i
will
tell
you
that
we
are
not
happy
.
i
said
nothing
,
for
i
saw
that
she
had
not
finished
.
she
began
slowly
,
walking
up
and
down
the
room
,
her
head
a
little
bent
,
and
that
slim
,
supple
figure
of
hers
swaying
gently
as
she
walked
.
she
stopped
suddenly
,
and
looked
up
at
me
.
you
don
t
know
anything
about
me
,
do
you
?
